        "summary": "Cricket fans across Australia have been left frustrated by a \"ridiculous\" process to buy pre-sale tickets for the upcoming Summer of cricket. Many reported being moved to the back of queues in excess of 190,000 people but a Ticketek spokesperson said the day of ticket sales went off \"without issue.\"",
        "raw_text": "The pre-sale for Ashes tickets has been beset by technical difficulties, with fans around the country having to wait in queues of tens of thousands \u2014 multiple times. Cricket Australia's \"priority pre-sale\" for itsSummer of Cricket\u2014 which includes the Australia vs England men's Ashes series, as well as other international ODIs and T20s \u2014 began on Tuesday morning. A one-off Test will be played against England at the MCG in March 2027, while the future of the Gabba clouds Brisbane's future calendar. The release was staggered from 10am AEST to 4pm AEST on its authorised ticketing agency Ticketek AU, with on-sale times varying depending on the match venue, to manage what it said was the \"expected demand and load on the ticketing systems\". It was not, however, categorised by the type of game, format or series. So, for instance, Queensland sales opened at 11am. This included tickets for every game in five stadiums across the state from Mackay to the Gold Coast. After waiting in the queue for hours, some patrons then said they were booted out of the transaction page and put at the back of the line. \"Was just in the queue at 20,000 and stuffed out and now I'm 195,000,\" a comment from Mark McGowan on a Cricket Australia Facebook post read. \"I sat there for 2 hours, bought the tickets and then it put me back in a queue of 200,000,\" said Jenny Paratz. \"Ticketek AU wouldn't let me purchase Ashes tickets, then sent me to the back of the queue and now there's 187,000 people in front of me,\" Declan Fay posted on X. At one point, there were nearly 200,000 people in the queue for tickets on Ticketek.(ABC News) Fans signed up to pre-sale access were also sent a \"unique password\" via email ahead of sale open time on Tuesday, but were put in the same queue as customers without a password. The first matches up for sale were Men's and Women's T20 and ODI matches scheduled against India to be played in Canberra and Hobart. Following that, at 11am AEST, all matches scheduled for stadiums in Queensland went up for sale, including the day-night Ashes match. Matches in South Australia and the Northern Territory were available to purchase from 1pm ACST. The remaining matches, in Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia, came online to buy at 2pm AEST, 3pm AEST and 4pm AEST respectively. In total, 26 fixtures went up for pre-sale on June 3. Some were frustrated that tickets to the Ashes, one of the most widely watched Test series in Australia, were not sold independently. Other commonly reported issues were the Ticketek website not allowing for more than one ticket to be selected, and invalidating transactions after payment details were entered. That was despite Cricket Australia telling users in pre-sale promotional emails that up to nine tickets could be bought per sale. \"Each code will allow you to purchase up to 9 tickets per match day \u2026 should you require more than 9 tickets for a match we suggest you have multiple people register for the priority pre-sale and purchase directly online so you do not miss out, noting it is unlikely you will get seats together,\" one email read. Australia is the current holder of the Ashes, a series it plays every two years against England.(Getty: Daniel Pockett/CA) A customer complaint on the Cricket Australia Instagram page called the sale process frustrating. \"Trying to buy tickets today for the Ashes has been one of the most frustrating experiences I've had in years. If I hadn't already spent several thousand in accommodation I would give up,\" Andrew Kempe said. \"I'm in my third queue for tickets for myself and my son. Every time it says not enough tickets available.\" A spokesperson for Ticketek told the ABC in a statement that Tuesday's sales had gone smoothly. \"We recognise that when we have high-demand events with limited inventory, that some fans will miss out and will be disappointed.\" Cricket Australia said it recorded its highest individual day of ticket sales in history, selling more than 220,000 tickets on Tuesday. The previous record of tickets sold in a single day for Cricket Australia was 111,741 during the 2017/18 pre-sale. That record was broken in just 5 hours this year. \"To surpass our previous ticket sales record even before NSW and WA tickets had gone on sale is a remarkable achievement,\" Cricket Australia chief executive Todd Greenberg said. \"I would urge those who haven't already bought their tickets to do so now as we expect allocations to be exhausted for some days.\" Cricket Australia confirmed to the ABC that some tickets were still available on pre-sale and the normal allocation for general sale, which starts on June 13. It was not clear what the exact numbers of tickets allocated to each round of sale were. The practice of ticket scalping, where tickets are bought from an authorised selling site to later be resold for profit, hasbeen on the risesince last year. That sometimes leads to genuine buyers being unable to purchase tickets, even minutes after they go on sale, because internet bots buy up tickets en masse much faster than a human could. It is an issue often seen as impacting music event sales. Ticketek claimed more than 1 million fans swarmed its site and bought more than 100,000 tickets to the Sydney, Melbourne and Gold Coast shows \"in a matter of hours\" last year during DJFred again..'s tour. Scalping was also rampant duringTaylor Swift's Eras tourticket sales in Australia. Ticketek said its point-of-sale system was designed to withstand bots. \"We encourage all customers not to use multiple browsers when trying to access tickets,\" a spokesperson said. \"Our systems are designed to prevent and block access from bots, and customers attempting to access the site with multiple browsers may be flagged by our bot prevention service.\"",

His comments come after Melbourne Victory's chairman and managing director lashed police for their \"disproportionate\" presence.",
        "raw_text": "Socceroos veteran Milo\u0161 Degenek wants to see flares back at Australian football matches, saying travelling teams now have it too easy due to fans being over policed. More than 50,000 spectators are expected on Thursday night when Australia host Japan in a crunch World Cup qualifier at Perth Stadium. The match will be played less than a week after riot police were called to control unruly fans walking to Melbourne City's A-League Men grand final win over arch-rivals Melbourne Victory, two-and-a-half years on from Victory's infamous pitch invasion. About 20 flares were lit in the crowd, with one police officer taken to hospital after allegedly being kicked. A police officer was assaulted in the lead-up to the A-League grand final between Melbourne Victory and Melbourne City, with claims flares were also thrown at some officers. Football Australia strictly bans flares and other pyrotechnics in and around stadiums, with perpetrators facing hefty bans. The Socceroos have played before plenty of hostile crowds over the years in various World Cup qualifying campaigns, but Degenek feels Australian fans aren't given the scope to return the favour. \"It would be a lot nicer if when countries come to Australia to play against us, the crowd was a little bit more hostile,\" Degenek said in Perth on Tuesday. \"Put it this way. I played in Serbia. I played at Red Star Belgrade, in the Eternal Derby where you play Partizan (Belgrade), where flares are thrown onto a pitch, where the city gets shut down on game day. \"But in the end, that's normal for me. There's no fear. Approximately 20 flares were lit in the crowd during the A-League grand final.(AAP: Con Chronis) \"There's a code in the footballing world: Fans are never going to attack footballers. \"I saw the pictures from the (A-League) grand final \u2014 a lot of police. \"For me, I just think it's nonsense that you have people in riot gear for guys who are going to a game. Victory chairman John Dovaston and managing director Caroline Carnegie lashed police for their \"disproportionate\" presence. \"The scenes we saw prior to the grand final on Swan Street were overwhelming and unacceptable,\" Carnegie and Dovaston said in an email to fans. \"Instead of promoting a fun and exciting spectacle of football, the extent of the police presence created fear amongst families and football fans alike. \"We need to create and demand long-term change. The Socceroos face Japan in a crucial World Cup qualifier on Thursday night.(Getty Images: Graham Denholm) \"There is a line between keeping people safe and creating fear in the first place, and we believe the latter is what occurred. This is not acceptable. We will not allow our members and fans to continue to be treated this way. \"While we would never accept anti-social behaviour, the disproportionate deployment only served to justify a narrative about football fans in this country.\" Degenek believes tightening down on people's rights with a huge police presence leads to more problems. \"In the end, you're going to force an issue, because you're narrowing down corridors where they can walk,\" he said. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines. \"You're pushing them to a side. Someone's going to step on someone, someone's going to push and then that escalates really quick, rather than give them freedom to move and getting them safely to a stadium.\" Degenek believes more people would attend games if they were policed less. \"You need to give the fans the freedom, the joy,\" he said. \"In Europe, you have less police, and that's where you have more fans at the games. \"And for us as footballers, it's a lot better when you see flares in the stadium, when you see fans screaming, chanting, flares going off, because that kind of gets the adrenaline going and motivates you even more.\" The Socceroos (13 points) sit second in their qualifying group. A win over Japan (20 points) would almost certainly lock in their place for the 2026 World Cup. AAP",

        "raw_text": "Nick Kyrgios's Wimbledon absence will stretch into a third year after the Australian tennis maverick suffered a fresh injury setback. Kyrgios hasn't played at Wimbledon since losing the 2022 final to Novak Djokovic, after a combination of knee, foot and wrist injuries. He had hoped to play doubles at the French Open with Jordan Thompson but withdrew from what would have been his first appearance at Roland-Garros since 2017 with a knee injury.

Last week, Thompson gave an insight into how much Kyrgios had struggled with his luckless injury run. \"He was pretty down.

        "raw_text": "You'd have every reason to think I am completely insane. Perhaps I am. I'm going to ignore this brief window of introspection though. After all, passion can manifest in a multitude of silly ways. Like flying to the other side of the world on a moment's notice (OK, four days' notice) for a football match between Southend United and Oldham Athletic \u2014 two clubs you've likely never heard of \u2014 in the National League promotion final at Wembley Stadium, London. That's England's fifth-tier competition \u2014 these clubs finished 97 and 99 rungs down the ladder fromPremier League winners Liverpoolin football's meritorious hierarchy. Wembley Way, English football's very own yellow brick road, highlights how far from home this reporter is.(ABC Sport: Simon Smale) A bloody long way from where I was 72 hours earlier in Brisbane, Australia. That's right, somewhat inexplicably, I embarked on a 33,072-kilometre round trip, with an absurd amount of anxiety and stress, and spent, quite frankly, an eye-watering amount of money for a single football match. So I tell myself to try not to think of the money. Heavens, don't do that. And certainly don't pause to think of what this does to your carbon footprint, which must be growing ominously like a boot's shadow over a hapless bug. No. Because as much as your rational self knows this trip is lunacy, your heart tells you that it is essential. On Wembley Way, English football's very own yellow brick road but miles from my own land of Australia, there was vindication for my madness. Instead of thinking about why you shouldn't be there, you remember the photo from the game before that sparked this insanity. My friends and family were among the fans rejoicing at Roots Hall as Southend reached the final. My brothers, in green, centre of shot. My friend, top left.(Supplied: Southend United) You think of the crowd of men and women in the process of leaping to their feet as one, roaring in ecstasy like some primal, human explosion. You think of the two men in mid-scream at the heart of that photo \u2014 your brothers. You think of the man top left \u2014 one of your oldest friends, mouth open, leaning forward as he gets to his feet amidst the surge of emotion of those around him. You think of your niece, representing her school team in one of the curtain-raiser matches on such hallowed turf. You think of the focus of their joy, their club \u2014 my club \u2014 inexplicably making yet another comeback to surge into a Wembley final. The club that a little over a year ago should probably have been wound up by the courts, 118 years of history extinguished by a judge very reasonably acting in the interests of any number of creditors who deserved their dues. And Southend fans had reason to fear because, asany Bury fan will tell you, history means nothing when the creditors come calling and the apathetic authorities stand aside. That was your club that was being run into the ground. Your club has not only been a driver of your formative years, it has nurtured and nourished generations of supporters since 1906. Your family. Your friends. Your city. Your club. Rationality is a meaningless irrelevance in the midst of such powerful emotional blackmail. Southend United's descent from the second tier has been swift.(Getty Images: PA Images/Stephen Pond) Let's rewind a bit because none of the above has a hope of making sense without some much-needed context. Much like many young kids in England, I was afflicted by the national obsession that is association football. Juvenile flirtations with the mega clubs of the 90s Premier League eventually gave way to the novelty of going to see my local team live, just down the road from my high school, as a teenager. The mockery directed towards my match-going friends for supporting a downtrodden club was replaced by an admiration for the depth of their faith and the lengths to which they would go to follow this ragtag group through the lower leagues of English football. The Roots Hall floodlights are a distinctive marker for the city's north.(Getty Images: PA Images/Stephen Pond) Roots Hall, Southend United's dilapidated home, became a weekly focus, its floodlights resembling a quartet of iron sentinels standing guard over the flimsy dreams and misguided ambitions of so many Saturday afternoons and Tuesday nights. So many hours spent uncomfortably in the cold under its semicircular iron roof, staring at the verdant patch of grass that even to a child looked smaller than what I expected from TV. So many trips around the country to stadiums big and small, from Carlisle to Swansea, and just about every town in between, with my oldest friends Alex and Paul. Despite happily living on the other side of the world, the absence of those connections carved out during the shared experiences of youth is a lasting sore on any expat. And so many of those experiences, for me at least, were cemented through adventures with this football club. Not all away trips are to Wembley, although Wealdstone's Grosvenor Vale ground is geographically close.(ABC Sport: Simon Smale) And yet this football club's very existence has been under threat. This side that flirted with the upper tiers of what is now known as the Championship in the early 90s, a team that held the then-European Champions Liverpool to a 0-0 draw in the FA Cup in 1979, a team that, on its last foray up the league pyramid beat Manchester United in the League Cup in 2006. From those heights, the club has plummeted. Successive relegations and several winding-up orders put the club out of the football league and into the fifth tier. A laboured and protracted sale of the club had the National League enforce an unprecedented 1 million pound (more than $2 million) bond on the club to even play in the league this past season, as it enforced yet another transfer embargo on the club pending its eventual, belated sale to a consortium led by Australian Justin Rees. Oh, ye of little faith. As Southend manager Kevin Maher wrote in his match program notes for this final: \"12 months ago and we didn't know if we'd even have a football club. You got that right. Despite that troubled start to the season, Southend repeatedly took thousands of fans home and away across the country, from Gateshead to Nailsworth, Boston to Yeovil. And then, claiming the last play-off spot in the final game of the season, proceeded to come from behind to beat both Rochdale (4-3 after extra-time) and Forest Green Rovers (2-2, 4-2 on penalties) away from home. Oldham Athletic fans have been through the ringer too.(Getty Images: PA Images/Adam Davy) Two teams had their stories played out in north London on Sunday and Oldham's is no less befitting a mammoth journey. The Latics have had their moments of pain and anguish over the three decades since they were one of the foundation teams of the Premier League. In its owner, Frank Rothwell \u2014 a man so delightfully northern that even his blood cells probably have their own flat caps \u2014 Oldham has a genuine fan who has the exceptional distinction of raising millions of pounds for charity and is committed to using his fortune to raise his town up. Frank Rothwell has owned Oldham since 2022.(Getty Images: MI News/NurPhoto/Eddie Garvey) \"The only thing I want to do with the rest of my days is help to make Oldham a better place for everybody, and that doesn't just mean taking our football club back into the League,\" Rothwell told the Mirror, heralding Oldham Athletic as a vehicle to help integrate the 30 per cent Asian population of the town. \"We are breaking down barriers in our town. Oldham Athletic is going to be a force for unity.\" You might not have heard of Bury Football Club. However, fans of football, and sports everywhere, should sit up and take note of its plight. A local man done good, Rothwell is spending most of his later years completing increasingly arduous challenges to raise money for charity \u2014 he twice solo rowed across the Atlantic Ocean in his 70s and has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro \u2014 as well as saving the Latics. \"Getting Oldham Athletic back on its feet has been the hardest [challenge I've done] by far,\" he told the Mirror. \"The place was feeling a bit sorry for itself and its very existence was on the line. \"We were so close to extinction the coroner was on stand-by.\" A first promotion in 35 years, arresting the inexorable slide from the top table to the basement, would be the crowning glory. The result certainly mattered to local Essex lad Nathan Ralph.(Getty Images: Offside/Jacques Feeney) Sunday morning. Thin sunlight shining its unforgiving rays on a largely deserted, dilapidated high street in Southend. It's seen better days, as has much of high street UK in the era of out-of-town retail centres and internet shopping. Would the smattering of people currently ambling along it be dreaming that, come 5pm, this day would rate as one of the football club's best? Those people in Southend United's blue shirts cast knowing glances at each other, wry smiles filled with optimism, hope, fear, excitement, and every possible emotion, as over 30,000 make the pilgrimage to Wembley. Thousands on trains. Thousands on buses. Wembley, when we get there, is a sea of blue \u2014 either the navy hue of Southend or Oldham's cobalt. A record crowd, 52,115 (this is England's fifth tier remember) all singing and dancing and roaring their charges onwards. Southend fans unveil a tifo as revealing as anything the club has been through over the last few years as the players run out amidst the pageantry and pyrotechnics at England's footballing cathedral \u2014 \"NEVER GIVE UP\" written large below the silhouette of a young fan who helped tidy Roots Hall during the club's darkest moments. Southend United's fighting spirit has been sorely tested.(Supplied: Southend United) Tell yourself it's not about the result as tears prick at the corner of your eyes at this reminder of the club's defiance. Sure, keep telling yourself that, a desperate attempt at self-preservation over this foolhardy venture. Keep telling yourself that when Southend takes the lead inside the opening 10 minutes and the southern half of Wembley erupts, strangers hugging each other across the aisles. Keep telling yourself that when Oldham equalises from the penalty spot just after half-time. Keep telling yourself that as the teams play out nine excruciating minutes of injury time before the torture begins anew with 30 minutes of extra-time, in which Southend retake the lead almost immediately after kicking off. And keep telling yourself that after Oldham score twice within a minute to ruin your dreams and crush your spirit. Oldham were successful, to the despair of Southend United.(Getty Images: PA Images/Adam Davy) The thing is, I think I probably believe it. This will be more difficult to grasp for those who don't believe, but the result is only a small part of the journey \u2014 while success is welcomed with open arms, few embark upon a lifetime of supporting their local lower league club with expectations of glory. And the journey for these Southend United fans was about so much more than victory in a one-off game. This is about the journey this community has been on over so many years, where hope and belief have been so painfully hard to come by. A community that has been dumped on and come within a hair's-breadth of extinction, saved only by a moment of benevolence and having the chance to experience this moment of togetherness, and so many others, saved. Even the act of coming together for this moment by the communities of Southend and Oldham was polluted and threatened by the organisational incompetence of the National League, Wembley Stadium, Transport for London and Brent Council. With planned engineering works at Wembley Park station, authorities had capped the attendance at Wembley at 35,000, a figure circumvented by the hiring of convoy coaches by the clubs and constant lobbying from club staff and politicians from both Essex and Lancashire. The 52,115 that were in the ground made this the highest attendance ever for a National League play-off final. This young fan still has a team to support.(Getty Images: PA Images/Adam Davy) No matter what obstacles were put ahead of these clubs and their supporters, they were still there. We were all still there. More than 50,000 of us from two clubs on the brink a matter of years ago. \"What is a club in any case? Not the buildings or the directors or the people who are paid to represent it,\" former England manager Sir Bobby Robson said of his beloved Newcastle United. \"It's the noise, the passion, the feeling of belonging, the pride in your city. \"It's a small boy clambering up the stadium steps for the very first time, gripping his father's hand, gawping at that hallowed stretch of turf beneath him, and without being able to do a thing about it, falling in love.\" That's what made this trip worth it.",

Maguire has been criticised of training the team too hard in some quarters, but it has been vehemently denied by skipper Adam Reynolds and Kotoni Staggs. Reynolds, who plays his 300th game this weekend, and centre Staggs insist the players have welcomed the hard edge provided by Maguire and slammed suggestions the playing group was disgruntled.

The Broncos have won one of their last seven matches and fallen in a heap in second halves of games, but Staggs said players had not been griping behind the scenes about Maguire's methods. \"That's a load of crap, I say,\" Staggs said. \"You've got to train hard.

I think any other club is doing the same as what we're doing. I think it's just excuses from outside noise that we can't control.\" Reynolds also disputed reports of player dissatisfaction with Maguire and his regime. \"It's easy to write headlines when you are not winning games. It's external and doesn't mean anything to us,\" he said. \"The conversations we are having in these four walls are the important ones. \"If you listen to people on the outside you end up on the outside, so for us we know what we are capable of and what type of football team we have. It's about sticking together, working hard and seeing it through. Reynolds is well qualified to speak about Maguire, having won the 2014 premiership under him at South Sydney.

I can assure you we will turn it around. \"We get prepared extremely well and as players we have to take the blame and responsibility for it. The only people that are going to get us out of this are ourselves.\" As for giving up against Manly, Staggs wouldn't have a bar of it. \"No, we didn't give up,\" he fired. \"There were times through the game where we could have been much better, yes, but there's no giving up there.\" AAP",

        "raw_text": "The AFL is at least weeks away from finalising its new-look illicit drugs code, with chief executive Andrew Dillon determined to negotiate a policy that is \"fit for purpose\". The AFL and players' association have been in talks for months about how the code should be developed, with some critics calling for zero tolerance. But the players' association, who approved the creation of the code in 2005, are determined that it stay primarily a welfare and health policy. \"We want to make sure we have the policy that is fit for purpose for '25 and beyond and it's a policy that has buy-in obviously from the AFL, the players' association, our clubs and our playing group,\" Dillon said on Tuesday. \"We will take the time to make sure that it's right.\" The revised illicit drugs policy \u2014 separate to the standard anti-doping policy \u2014 will be a key responsibility for Laura Kane. Kane was a big casualty in Dillon's executive shake-up announced last Friday, with her football operations role split in two. Current Brisbane CEO Greg Swann will join the AFL and become the new head of football performance, while Kane will be in charge of football operations. Dillon is adamant Laura Kane remains a valued member of the AFL's executive team despite the recent league re-structure.(Getty Images: AFL Photos/Michael Willson) Her portfolio will now include operations for the AFL and AFLW, the strategic growth of the AFLW and managing the league's mental health and healthcare unit. \"Laura is a valued member of the executive team \u2014 she has an incredible portfolio, a big portfolio in front of her now,\" Dillon said. \"What I've said is we want to make sure we have a structure that allows the AFL to continue the momentum we have, into the future. \"She's done amazing work in the three years she's been at the AFL. What we have now with Greg coming in looking after the football performance, Laura continuing to run football operations \u2014 football is at the core of what we do. Another major change to Dillon's executive team is the imminent departure of Indigenous and inclusion manager Tayna Hosch. Her role, which includes gender, will be folded into the corporate affairs portfolio. \"Tanya, in her nearly nine years at the AFL, did an incredible amount of work in this space,\" Dillon said. \"We have incredible leaders across all tiers of the organisation \u2014 Denise Bowden, who's just joined our commission, an Indigenous advisory council that's working really well. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines. \"What we will have is more leaders and more voices across the organisation. Our commitment to our inclusion is as strong as it's ever been.\" Dillon is also days away from appointing his chief operating officer. Club chief executives Tom Harley (Sydney), Ameet Bains (Western Bulldogs) and Simon Garlick (Fremantle) are the key candidates, while there is speculation Melbourne Cricket Club boss Stuart Fox also might be in the running. While Dillon's executive changes follow months of growing concerns about how the AFL is performing, he is bullish about the league. \"What the announcements from last week do is ensure we can continue the momentum we have and make sure we're set up for success going into the future,\" he said. Dillon was speaking at the announcement of free admission for children under 14 later this season. Select games will feature the initiative in rounds 16-19 and all Victorian games will be free for kids in round 21. AAP",

        "raw_text": "Three-time Olympic track gold medallist Gabby Thomas says she was verbally abused at a meet in Philadelphia last weekend, the latest incident of harassment the American has reported this year. Thomas, who won gold in the 200 metres, as well as the 4x100m and 4x400m relays at the Paris Games, said in a post on X that a man followed her around at the Grand Slam Track meet while she took pictures for fans and signed autographs, shouting insults at her. A man displaying \"fixated behaviour\" towards Emma Raducanu was removed from the Dubai Championships venue after the British player burst into tears after seeing him courtside. \"Anybody who enables him online is gross,\" Thomas wrote. Thomas's post was in response to another on X that contained a video of a person heckling Thomas while she was on the starting line, shouting \"you're a choke artist \u2014 you're going down, Gabby\". \"I made Gabby lose by heckling her. And it made my parlay win,\" the social media user wrote, with a screenshot of two online multi-leg bets. The track circuit said in a statement: \"Grand Slam Track is conducting a full investigation into the reprehensible behaviour captured on video. \"We are working to identify the individual involved and will take appropriate action as necessary. \"We will implement additional safeguards to help prevent incidents like this in the future. Let us be clear, despicable behaviour like this will not be tolerated.\" Thomas finished third overall in the short sprints group for the Philadelphia meet, the third in the novel circuit's inaugural season. One of America's brightest stars in track, the 28-year-old Thomas catapulted to mainstream fame after her breakout performance in Paris, gracing the cover of American Vogue magazine and appearing on US talk shows. But Thomas has also suffered the darker side of fame, describing on TikTok this year how she was stalked by a group of men at several airports, as social media gives female athletes greater exposure. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines. The incident at Grand Slam Track also reflected a growing link between sports betting and harassment, with female tennis players, including Caroline Garcia, pointing to \"unhealthy betting\" as a key culprit. Major tennis governing bodies moved to combat online abuse and published a report last year that attributed nearly half of abusive social media posts to angry gamblers. \"Thank you for pointing out this disgusting behaviour,\" retired former world 10,000m silver medallist Kara Goucher wrote on X. \"You are exposing the crap that women go through and will eventually help other women as well.\" Reuters",

Australia's 4-1 win over Argentina marked his 151st game as coach or interim coach of the Matildas, in stints dating back to 1994. Joe Montemurro now takes over as Matildas coach from the Scottish-born Sermanni.",
        "raw_text": "When Tom Sermanni first took charge of the Australian women's national football team, they were not playing in front of sell-out crowds. They were not even called the Matildas. As international team manager * - Australian women's team was first known as the Matildas in 1995 ** - Interim Matildas coach Sermanni's first home game as coach of the Female Socceroos, as they were still known back in 1995, was played in front of a handful of spectators at a training ground at the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra. His last was in front of a capacity crowd of 25,125 next door at Canberra Stadium on Monday night. That is a record not just for a women's football game in the ACT, but any football game played in the nation's capital. It is the highest attendance of any sport at the venue in almost six years. \"It's bizarre,\" Sermanni reflected, following his final match as interim coach before Joe Montemurro steps into the role. \"It's just been a phenomenal experience. I've never witnessed a crowd such as the Matildas crowd. \"I kind of pinch myself when I go out and stand in front of it before the game starts. Tom Sermanni gave Sam Kerr her full international debut in 2009.(AAP: Dan Himbrechts) \"I just can't believe I'm back and had the privilege to be back in this environment.\" As he ends his third, and probably final, stint at the helm of the Matildas, the landscape of women's football in Australia is unrecognisable from when he first encountered it. That is largely down to Sermanni, 70, himself. In his first tenure, from 1994 to 1997, the charismatic Caledonian led the Matildas to their first World Cup. But it was his contribution off the field that had the biggest impact. From a small office in the Canberra suburb of Hackett, Sermanni and a team of two or three running the entire women's program established the foundations for the National Training Centres that would incubate the golden generation of Australian women's football. \"I think that was one of the things, if I look back, that we created that I feel was really beneficial,\" he said \"And the second thing was the W-League. I think the W-League has been really instrumental in giving opportunities to domestic players that might not have had opportunities if we didn't have that league.\" Tom Sermanni's second stint as the Australian women's team coach saw him take the Matildas to the FIFA 2007 World Cup in China.(Getty Images: Paul Gilham) In his second stint, from 2004 to 2012, Sermanni handed debuts to a crop of young players \u2014 including the likes of Sam Kerr, Steph Catley and Caitlin Foord \u2014 who took the Matildas to another level and nearly a home World Cup final in 2023. But the decision to can the National Training Centres program in 2014 set back the development of new talent and left a shortage of new players coming through to replace them, Sermanni lamented. ABC Sport and Deakin University have partnered to produce the first ABC Elite Athletes in Australian Women's Sport Survey. \"We need to put resources into development,\" he said. \"You don't notice your development collapsing overnight. It takes time, and then all of a sudden, we turn around and say, we've got all these great players, but they're 30-plus.\" Now unemployed, the longest-serving coach of the Matildas does not know what his future holds, but he left the door open to continuing his relationship with Football Australia. \"We've had some chats, but there's been no particular concrete role. So I think everybody will just wait to see what happens when things change and things start to happen again,\" he said. \"If there's something there, fantastic. If there's not, I'll be quite happy to leave the building and relax.\" AAP",

        "raw_text": "A proud Daria Kasatkina says the embrace she has felt from Australia during her first grand slam under its flag was like nothing she had ever known in her tennis career. Kasatkina finally bowed out at the French Open on Monday, beaten by the 18-year-old phenom and her fellow Russian-born friend Mirra Andreeva 6-3, 7-5 after what the victorious teenager rightly called a \"hell of a match\" in the fourth round at Roland-Garros. Two months after being granted permanent residency, Kasatkina's hopes of becoming the first Australian woman to reach the quarterfinals since Ash Barty's triumphant year of 2019 fell short, but the 28-year-old said she enjoyed being the \"last Aussie standing\". \"It's been a good start,\" she said. \"First of all it's been a good result but also, I felt super good to step on the court as an Australian player. \"To feel the support from the stands so many times. I don't know if everyone who was screaming, 'Aussie', were from Australia, but I felt this support. Also, on social media I'm getting a lot of support from the Australians that they are so happy to welcome me, and they're happy for me. \"So this is the kind of support which I honestly didn't have before, it feels like it's something new to me \u2014 but it feels so nice.\" When asked if everyone was now allowed to call her \"an Aussie battler\" after she had given the sixth seed a real scare with her second-set counterattack when she even earned a set point, Kasatkina offered a wry smile and replied: \"If you want to \u2026\" It was a tremendous match full of variety, like blitz chess between two all-court grandmasters, played in a fabulous spirit by two training partners. Their 94-minute duel on Court Suzanne Lenglen ended with Kasatkina chucking her wristband jokingly at her conqueror at the net, while Andreeva informed the crowd tongue-in-cheek that she only practised with the Aussie because she hated her. \"Maybe we know each other too good, maybe we have to take a break in practising \u2026 no, I'm kidding,\" Kasatkina said. The only other time they had played a match was in the final of last October's Ningbo Open in China, with Andreeva ending in tears and needing to be comforted by the player 10 years her senior after blowing a 3-0 lead in the final set. Things have clearly changed. Andreeva has grown up. This time, she said it was easy to put friendship aside as she repelled Kasatkina's second-set surge when the world No.17 went from 3-1 down to 5-3 up, with a combination of the most extraordinary defensive resolve and some ferocious attacking shots. All looked lost for Kasatkina at the start of the second, but she lived up to her promise that she was ready to \"die on court\" as she chased down seemingly impossible causes and even outlasted the youngster to win one remarkable 26-shot rally. And that utter determination did give Andreeva problems as Kasatkina earned a set point on the youngster's delivery at 5-4, only to be deprived by a powerful forehand. Once back level, Andreeva began to dictate. One piece of amazing retrieving also induced a dismal Kasatkina smash into the net, and enabled her to break to love, before she sealed the deal on her second match point when the Aussie hit a forehand long. Andreeva has reached the quarters without dropping a set and is the youngest woman this century to achieve back-to-back last-eight appearances. Martina Hingis last did it in 1998. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines. Asked if her input in practice might have helped Andreeva mature, Kasatkina said: \"I hope not!\" But she did recognise a completely different force to the player she played in Ningbo. \"Well, she grew so much. I feel like she's taller and taller every single week, her serve's improving all the time and her movement is very good,\" she said. Australian interest remains strong around the grounds, with world No.2 junior Emerson Jones through to the second round of the girls' event with a 6-1, 1-6, 6-2 win over American Capucine Jauffret. Olympic men's doubles champions John Peers and Matt Ebden beat Italian fourth seeds Andrea Vavassori and Simone Bolelli 6-2, 7-6 (8-6) to make the quarter-finals. Top-ranked men's player Jannik Sinner's latest dominant performance at the French Open was a 6-1, 6-3, 6-4 victory over No.17 Andrey Rublev to reach the quarterfinals and extend his Grand Slam winning streak to 18 matches. Sinner is a three-time major champion who won the US Open last September and the Australian Open this January. Now he'll try to get to the semifinals at Roland-Garros for the second consecutive year and faces 62nd-ranked Alexander Bublik on Wednesday. Sinner hasn't lost a set and has dropped a total of 30 games in Paris so far. Sinner began somewhat slowly against Rublev under the lights at Court Philippe-Chatrier. Well, for four points, anyway. Rublev got two break points at 15-40 in the opening game, but Sinner erased those and was on his way. He only faced one other break point the rest of the match and saved it, too. Sinner finished the first set with 10 winners to just three unforced errors and kept the pressure on Rublev. Alexander Bublik became the first man from Kazakhstan to reach the quarterfinals at a Grand Slam tournament, eliminating No.5 Jack Draper 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4. The 27-year-old Bublik dropped to the court, smudging himself with the red clay, when he finished off the biggest win of his career. \"Sometimes in life, there is only one chance, and I had a feeling that that was mine and I couldn't let it slip,\" he told the crowd afterward. \"Standing here is the best moment of my life. Period.\" Moments later, he joked: \"I'm standing here like I won the thing.\" Bublik managed to produce a total of 68 winners, 31 more than the left-handed Draper. At No.62, Bublik is the lowest-ranked man to earn a pair of victories at Roland-Garros against opponents ranked in the top 10 since No.100 Andrei Medvedev in 1999. Bublik came back from a two-set deficit to defeat No.9 Alex de Minaur in the second round last week. \"I have a certain skill set to play tennis,\" Bublik said. \"And it worked marvelously today \u2014 100 per cent one of the best days of my life and one of the best matches I have ever played in my life.\" Novak Djokovic earned his 100th career French Open victory, a mark surpassed among men only by Rafael Nadal, by overwhelming Cam Norrie 6-2, 6-3, 6-2. Djokovic hasn't ceded a set on his way to the quarterfinals this year at Roland-Garros, where he has won three of his 24 Grand Slam titles. \"I feel good. Every day, I have more expectations about my game, (and with) 12 sets played, 12 sets won, everything is solid and positive,\" Djokovic said. The 38-year-old Serbian had a pair of three-match losing streaks this season but seems to be in top form lately, including collecting his 100th title at the Geneva Open the week before play began in Paris. He also beat Norrie in Geneva. \"He was solid today, and he didn't give me anything,\" Norrie said. \"Defending well, serving well, returning well and very sharp.\" Next up for Djokovic is a matchup against No.3 seed Alexander Zverev. \"He definitely knows how to play tennis. He definitely knows what it means to be on the big stage and to play big matches,\" Zverev said about Djokovic. \"There is no doubt about that.\" Djokovic improved to 100-16 at the French Open. Nadal, who retired at the end of last season, went 112-4 while winning a record 14 championships at the clay-court major. Coco Gauff earned her fifth consecutive trip to the French Open quarterfinals with a straight-sets victory, but she still is catching flak because she forgot to bring her racquets to a match earlier in the tournament. The No.2-seeded Gauff, who won the 2023 US Open and was the runner-up in Paris in 2022, has been engaging in a bit of back-and-forth with another American and Roland-Garros quarterfinalist, Frances Tiafoe, over the equipment blunder. Tiafoe teasingly called the 21-year-old Gauff \"Mrs Mature.\" Gauff's retort: \"I feel like maybe just playing tennis, it forces you to grow up faster for some people. Maybe not him.\" It was Tiafoe who first made that very mistake back in March, showing up for a match at the tournament in Indian Wells, California, without his racquets. He got plenty of ribbing on social media and from other players \u2014 including Gauff. So when Gauff went to Court Philippe-Chatrier for her first-round match last week and opened her bag only to realise there weren't any rackets inside, the 27-year-old Tiafoe was only too happy to call her out. \"She was full out shaking her whole bag like it was an empty cookie jar on Chatrier. I was like, 'What are you doing?' \u2026 I'm going to keep ripping her for a long time. I've never seen someone (ranked No.2) in the world have zero things in her bag. That was incredible,\" Tiafoe said. \"That kind of thing is so big because it just makes everyone (realise) we're all human. People make mistakes, whether it's the team or her or whatever. \"That was a funny moment, especially (because) she tries to be Mrs Mature. That was great. I'm happy it happened to her. Hopefully it happens again.\" Lo\u00efs Boisson never had played at the French Open, let alone in the biggest arena at Roland-Garros. Nothing fazed the French wild card entry and now she is in the quarterfinals. Boisson, ranked 361st, threw her head back and roared after beating No.3 seed Jessica Pegula 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 on Court Philippe-Chatrier. She is by far the lowest-ranked woman to beat someone ranked in the top five at the French Open in 40 years. The lowest previously in that span was No.179 Aniko Kapros, who eliminated No.5 Justine Henin in the first round in 2002. Boisson also is the lowest-ranked woman to reach the quarterfinals at Roland-Garros since at least 1985. Quite a victory, considering Pegula was the US Open runner-up last year. Understandably, Boisson was nervous as she served for the match and saved three break points. After Pegula missed an easy-looking winner at the net and clutched her head in her hands, Boisson had her first match point, the biggest point of her career. Pegula returned a strong serve to the back of the court, where Boisson unleashed a forehand winner down the line. She then raised her arms and realised the enormity of her win. \"Thank you to all of you,\" Boisson told the crowd in her post-match interview. \"Playing on this court with such an atmosphere was really incredible.\" AAP/AP",

        "raw_text": "The Matildas have drawn the curtain on interim coach Tom Sermanni's third spell in charge of the national team with a commanding 4-1 victory over Argentina in Canberra. Incoming manager Joe Montemurro watched on as returning young gun Amy Sayer, who was starting her first Matildas game in 549 days, scored twice in a first half in which she starred. Argentina's Kishi Nunez also got on the scoresheet in the opening period, but the visitors offered little after the break. Australia dictated much of the play and pressed high as veteran Emily van Egmond and then hometown hero Michelle Heyman found the back of the net late on. Australia was too good for Argentina in Canberra.(Getty Images: Matt King) But it wasn't all good news for the green and gold. Friday's debut goal scorer and the assister of Sayer's first goal tonight, Kahli Johnson, hobbled off the field mid-way through the first half. It was a promising, professional performance from Australia, but really, what was happening on the field felt more like a subplot. The camera often panned to Montemurro, who, earlier on Monday, had been unveiled by Football Australia as the Matildas' next permanent manager after a prolonged, 10-month recruitment process. Sermanni, likewise, got his share of the screen time as he made the most of a Matildas sell-out for the last time. Sermanni passed the torch to Montemurro in Canberra.(Getty Images: Matt King) \"The crowds are just phenomenal,\" Sermanni told Paramount Plus. \"I still pinch myself every time I walk out to a Matildas game at home. \"The passion of the crowd, the size of the crowd, the noise \u2014 it's just an amazing atmosphere. \"It's just amazing \u2014 it's something you strive and strive to do, especially back in the days when you essentially got friends and family to come to games and you dream of stuff like this. \"It's just a dream come true.\" The Matildas' next step towards the 2026 Asian Cup comes at the end of June, when they host Slovenia for a pair of friendly matches. Relive all the action in our blog below. By Chris De Silva By Henry Hanson It was a dominant display from the Matildas tonight. Amy Sayer, starting her first international match in 549 days, shone particularly bright. She scored a cool first half brace before veterans Emily van Egmond and Michelle Heyman found the net in the second period. 19-year-old Kishi Nunez got on the scoresheet for Argentina in between Sayer's two strikes, although her side offered little after that. But of course, what happened on the park was relegated to something of a sub-plot tonight. With the incoming Joe Montemurro watching on from the stands, and Tom Sermanni in the dugout for the last time, we saw a successful passing of the torch in Canberra. And a fitting farewell for a legend of Australian football. Thank you so much for joining me tonight - I've had an absolute ball bringing you all the action. Until next time! By Henry Hanson Caitlin Foord is now talking to Paramount Plus. Typically tenacious, electric and determined, she was at the heart of a lot of what was good about the Matildas tonight. But she's not taking any of the spotlight from Sermanni, and she's reflecting on his previous stint in charge, from 2005 to 2012. \"I can't thank him enough for bringing me into this Matildas squad,\" Foord says. \"Along with many of the other senior girls as well, he started our career and it was almost a full circle to have him back in.\" And she's full of praise for his work getting the team back on track after a dreadful 2024 Olympics. \"He was the right person to step in,\" Foord says. \"He knows the team, he brought back that Australian fight within us. \"And now he hands it over to Joe.\" By Henry Hanson Tom Sermanni is talking to Paramount Plus about his immediate plans. \"I don't know - I'm an unemployed pensioner so maybe a lolly pop man at the school crossings,\" Sermanni says. \"No I don't know, I always do a little bit out my Western Sydney Wanderers club, so I'll continue to do that. \"I'll just see what comes along. If nothing comes along, I'll put my feet up and relax.\" Whatever's ahead of him, he certainly deserves the world. What a legend. By Henry Hanson Tom Sermanni is talking to Paramount Plus and he's reflecting on the cultural phenomenon that is the Matildas. Keep in mind, his first stint in charge of the team was in the early 90s, and his second in the 00s. \"The crowds are just phenomenal,\" Sermanni says. \"I still pinch myself every time I walk out to a Matildas game at home. \"The passion of the crowd, the size of the crowd, the noise - it's just an amazing atmosphere. \"It's just amazing - it's something you strive and strive to do, especially back in the days when you essentially got friends and family to come to games and you dream of stuff like this. \"It's just a dream come true.\" By Henry Hanson Perhaps a bit of an understatement for the two goal hero. She was electric on her first Matildas start for 549 days, and she's talking to Paramount Plus. \"It's an indescribable feeling,\" Sayer says. \"I was playing in an unfamiliar position, it's only my second game back and I was under the tutelage of the amazing Tom Sermanni for the first time. \"It's a great, great night.\" And she's happy to fill in wherever needed as long as she's in green and gold. \"I love the midfield, that's my favourite, but I really did cover all over the frontline tonight,\" Sayer says. \"But honestly anywhere on the field, I think my strength is my versatility and a lot of coaches see that so that's how I end up covering a lot of positions.\" What a performance. By Henry Hanson A fitting end to the third Tom Sermanni era. An exciting, electric first half display from Amy Sayer stole the show tonight, for me anyway. She scored two excellent goals as the Matildas made the most of a bright start in Canberra. In the second, the Matildas were all over Argentina. They got on the scoresheet twice more, but might be a little disappointed they didn't ram home their advantage further. The visitors were at least a sporadic threat to begin, but by the end of the match, they were out on their feet, camped deep inside their own half and inviting all kinds of pressure. Michelle Heyman and Emily van Egmond the scorers in the second 45. Over to you, Joe Montemurro. By Henry Hanson Argentina really hasn't shown much in this second half, and they look pretty shattered as we make our way towards stoppage time. They are sitting very deep now and the Matildas can sniff another goal. The Australians are pressing high and circulating the ball assuredly. It comes to the newly introduced Issy Gomez on the edge of the box, who attempts an audacious flick, but it flies wide. By Henry Hanson Some more sloppy play from Argentina. A poor back pass is met with an even poorer touch on the edge of the box. Caitlin Foord sniffs an opportunity and gets her foot in. It bounces to the on-rushing Michelle Heyman, who stretches, takes it around the goalkeeper and bundles in it. A fitting goal for the Canberra star! By Henry Hanson The official crowd numbers are in. Just over 25 000 fans have come to watch Tom Sermanni's last game in charge of the Matildas. By Henry Hanson Isabel Gomez, after a stellar A-League season, is on for her Matildas debut. Kaitlyn Torpey and Jamilia Rankin are also on. By Henry Hanson It's a really lazy bit of play from Argentina. An undercooked back pass is intercepted by the hustling Michelle Heyman. She jinks and squirms and but can't quite get a shot away. However, the ball bounces out to the incoming Emily van Egmond, who slots it home. It's 3-1, and a deserved two goal lead for the Matildas. By Henry Hanson Foord is a gun. Clever, skilled, dynamic, tenacious . Such a lynchpin and so fun to watch! - Ann Absolutely! And she's just getting better and better. By Henry Hanson KCC runs onto a loose ball in Australia's attacking third. She's looking up straight away and plays a delightful, deft ball into the feet of Michelle Heyman. The recently introduced striker's first shot is blocked, but the ball squirts back out to her. She gets another one away, but it's well saved at the near post. By Henry Hanson And those substitutions have come now. It's a giant roar as the crowd sees Michelle Heyman and Alanna Kennedy readying themselves on the touchline. The players to make way are Tash Prior and two goal sensation Amy Sayer. By Henry Hanson A long, diagonal ball from deep on the Argentine left is just about dealt with by the Australian defence. However, the clearance is only as far as goal scorer Kishi Nunez. She does her best to take it in her stride, but can't. The Matildas rebuild and the ball is up the other end in a flash. A delightful, floated ball from the right finds Caitlin Foord at the far post. She makes good contact with her left foot and should score from the edge of the six yard box. But the ball cannons into the post and Argentina survives. By Henry Hanson The ball is flung in from the right and it finds Holly McNamara on the edge of the six yard box. She controls it on the chest, lets it bounce, and leathers one at goal. The Argentine GK, Pereyra, is down smartly to her left and it's fine save. Argentina gets the ball away. McNamara's quest for a maiden international goal goes on. By Henry Hanson A lovely duo of deft through balls - first from EVE and then from Caitlin Foord - get the ball to Amy Sayer on the edge of the box, slightly to the right. On a hat-trick, her eyes light up a touch. She lashes at it and it flies over the bar. By Henry Hanson The second half has pretty quickly settled into a similar pattern to the first. Argentina is sitting off and the Matildas are circulating the ball in the centre of the park. It's work forward to the left and across, but Argentina regains the ball deep. The visitors attempt to build from the back, but the Australians are pressing effectively. They win in it back hight up the field but can't find a way through the last line of defence. The Matildas recycle and the ball finds its way to Holly McNamara on the edge of the 'Tilies attacking third. She's pulled down and it's a free kick. Catley steps up and chips over a pretty lackadaisical ball into the box which dribbles out harmlessly for a goal kick. By Henry Hanson And we're back! No half-time changes for the Matildas - but you feel some aren't too far away.",

        "raw_text": "When you go to see Kerry Lyons for support, Chives is there to help you too. He's an 11-year-old Devon Rex cat, and works with Kerry, who is an accredited social worker in Brisbane/Meanjin, as part of her feline-assisted therapy program. \"Cats can have a really calming and gentle presence in the therapy room, but they also need the people around them to be emotionally regulated,\" says Ms Lyons. Assisted therapy is just one context in which \"therapy cats\" are becoming increasingly common. They're also paying visit to facilities such as aged-care homes and hospitals, and being registered as assistance animals. So what makes cats so therapeutic and how do they compare to other therapy animals? Bandit might just be the coolest cat in town, attending festivals and frequenting shops and cafes. But to her owner Anthorr, Bandit is much more than an adventure buddy, she's his support to leave the house each day. Animal-assisted services may help manage disability, illness and suffering, according to Animal Therapies Ltd. That can include autism, post-traumatic stress disorder, and asthma, for example. The organisation's founder Wendy Coombe explains in some contexts, the person working with the animal is a health professional, while in others, such as visitation to facilities including aged care, the human doesn't necessarily require a qualification. \"There are different types of animal-assisted practitioners that are working alongside cats \u2014 and what type of service they are delivering depends on the human qualifications of that registered health professional,\" Ms Coombe says. \"Then you have other professionals who might be teachers or educators, and they've undertaken an animal-assisted learning certified course and are delivering skills, development or training and may have cats as part of that.\" For example, someone in a farm setting teaching a person how to regulate their emotions in the presence of a horse. There are only a handful of government-registered assistance cats, which Ms Coombe says \"help alleviate disabilities of handlers, that meet the standards of hygiene and behaviour\". Chives enjoys meeting new people, owner Kerry says.(Supplied) Ms Lyons works primarily with children and young adults, focusing on emotional regulation, connection, social skills, problem solving and confidence. She became interested in feline-assisted therapy when she noticed Chives offering comfort to clients in her waiting room, which is also connected to her husband's at-home acupuncture clinic. \"During COVID in the early days, our family cat would sit in the waiting area in her favourite spot on a long bench, and almost without fail, every client that was sitting waiting would pat her and say to me 'I don't normally like cats, but this one is different.'\" Ms Lyons says Chives isn't \"necessarily different\", but that she did notice how calming and friendly she was at a time when people were really stressed. And while people commonly think of dogs and horses in animal assisted therapies, Ms Lyons says cats offer something unique. \"Horses are a prey animal, so they have really highly refined nervous systems \u2014 that impacts how they interact with people. \"Then dogs are actually [considered] predators, and have developed with people. Their relational skills are really important in their work.\" Cats, on the other hand, are both prey and predator, Ms Lyons says. As a result, cats need to feel safe, and need those around them to be emotionally regulated. But at the same time, Ms Lyons says, they have a lot to offer in terms of calmness and connection. She says there is evidence to show their soft touch andpurr is soothing. Animal Therapies Ltd's Ms Coombe says cats are ideal for visiting schools, hospitals and care homes, where larger animals might not be suitable or where there are people whomight be afraid of dogs. People in aged care often miss the warmth a cat can provide, says Ms Coombe.(Pexels) She says cats being able to sit on someone's lap means they can provide that \"close touch and warmth with another living thing\". \"That is what a lot of people in aged care miss. \"Interacting with an animal in that context in a very positive way can increase oxytocin \u2026 and reduce cortisol which is the stress [hormone].\" Not every cat is suited to working in animal-assisted therapy, explains Ms Coombe. An animal is assessed to ensure they are safe to interact with a client base, and to ensure it is comfortable in those situations. \"If they show any signs of stress, then they are not suitable for this kind of work,\" Ms Coombe says. \"We can't compromise on the safety of the human or the welfare of the animal.\" Kerry says Chives is a soothing presence for clients.(Supplied) Ms Lyons says working in animal-assisted therapy, it's the human's duty to consider the welfare of the animal as much as the client. Regina Hall-Jones is a cat behaviour consultant and says some cats thrive on having interactions with new people. \"While most cats do like a secure, familiar environment, others like seeing new things and enjoy going out.\" And while a cat's personality is not always breed-based, Ms Hall-Jones says breeds such as Bengals are more likely to be happier travelling outside of the home. Ms Lyons says Chives enjoys meeting new people and experiencing new smells. \"She chose this work herself, that's what started my journey.\"",

        "raw_text": "If you work in an office, you may be doing it already. Hot-desking is the norm in workplaces across the country, usually open-plan offices. But our office etiquette doesn't always reflect how normal hot-desking and open-plan offices have become, according to Natsha Hawker, the managing director of a human resources and recruitment service on Gadigal land in Sydney. Paula Brough is an organisational psychology professor at Griffith University in Brisbane/Meanjin and says hot-desking has been increasing across all sectors since the COVID-19 pandemic. Paula Brough says hot-desking can take some adjustment for workers.(Supplied: Paula Brough) Professor Brough says hot-desking evolved from the popularity of open-plan offices. She says it's \"highly beneficial\" for employers, allowing them to continue supporting some working from home, while saving money on office space and equipment. According to Ms Hawker, \"many businesses are looking for ways to reduce; reduce expenditure and reduce the office footprint\". Ms Hawker says from personal experience, hot-desking comes with \"the benefit of learning by osmosis\". She says she has previously learnt a lot from the different people she has sat next to and the way they work. Professor Brough says how well people handle hot-desking will depend on their personality traits. She says a busy office of rotating desks is more likely to work for someone who is chatty and extroverted, and collaborative discussions in this type of environment could also help generate ideas and stimulate creativity. Emeline Gaske says hot-desking can strip away the \"stability and routine that people need to do their jobs well\".(Supplied: Australian Services Union) \"But you have to be the right person to fit that environment,\" she says. \"People tend to be productive when they feel comfortable\". In offices with a hot-desking policy, the organisation is ideally making the environment more comfortable in other ways. The Australian Services Union's National Secretary Emeline Gaske says hot-desking cuts costs at the expense of workers' morale and productivity. She says the union is seeing a \"real tension between employers pushing hot-desking and workers' desire for flexibility and consistency\". \"It strips away the stability and routine that people need to do their jobs well.\" How do you make hot-desking work for you? Emaileveryday@abc.net.au. How do you make hot-desking work for you? Emaileveryday@abc.net.au. Ms Hawker recommends introducing yourself to the people sitting around you in the first 30 minutes of being at a new desk. \"If you're popping out for a coffee, ask anyone if they want one,\" she suggests. Noise can be a common source of office tension, so Ms Hawker suggests \"keeping personal calls and noise levels to a minimum\". Employers should also have cleaning products and hand sanitiser ready to access for staff rotating between desks, she says. Ms Hawker says employers should ideally also provide personal lockers so desks are left uncluttered at the end of the day. Natasha Hawker is the managing director of an HR and recruitment organisation.(Supplied) Professor Brough and Ms Hawker both point out that regardless of workplace policies, people are \"naturally territorial\" and \"creatures of habit\". Professor Brough says if the desk someone normally sit at is taken, that may \"cause a little bit of internal disruption to people\". However, organisations usually have a clear set of rules around hot-desking, such as no desk-claiming and no leaving belongings behind. Ms Hawker says, \"people gravitate towards the same desk every day; if that desk is already taken it can really put them off and sometimes generate friction\". Experts explain what's reasonable when it comes to a workplace dress code. She says you would need to be in the office a minimum of four days to feel able to claim a desk, because most people who work partly from home are in the office for three days. \"Some employers are adopting a policy of '[if] you're in the office four days a week, then you can claim a desk as a reward.'\" She recommends speaking with someone directly and discreetly if you have an issue. If you are uncomfortable doing that or it's not possible, Ms Hawker suggests speaking with your manager \u2014 and possibly human resources.",

        "raw_text": "I always thought that by my mid-20s, I'd have a life like Monica Geller from Friends, living in a cosy apartment in Sydney's bustling CBD. But life had other plans. I suppose that's the beauty of being young and naive; when you're in your early 20s, you believe life will turn out just as you imagine, even when reality suggests otherwise. For me, reality was loud and clear: \"You can't afford to rent, and you're not eligible for a large mortgage loan.\" Nothing highlighted my inability to access the housing market more than my employment status. Despite being among the minority of people with disabilities who were gainfully employed, my earnings were rarely sufficient. I drifted between two worlds: living at home with stability but limited independence, and subletting a room and sacrificing personal space. Attempts to improve my financial situation were often met with silence from potential employers, who seemed to see my disability before they saw my qualifications. Being locked out of the housing market forces you to rethink your options and face an uncomfortable truth: the dream of home ownership might always remain just that, a dream. For me, this was a problem that needed to be solved. The process of buying the land was an unfamiliar one, which made me anxious, but once it was complete, there was space for possibilities.(Shauna Foley) Growing up as a first-generation Australian with a disability, thousands of kilometres away from my extended family, I often worried about the lack of support for me beyond my mother and sister. With no inheritance or 'bank of mum and dad' to rely on, securing my future wasn't just a goal, it was a necessity. A TV show called Building Off Grid \u2014 about people who have chosen a less travelled path to home ownership \u2014 opened my eyes to the freedom I have to choose my own path. I had a light-bulb moment; why not buy 1,000 to 2,000 square metres of land and build a place of my own? I set a maximum budget of $20,000, a figure that made my friends and family think I was bluffing. However, it was an amount that my savings could easily cover and I would be mortgage free. My criteria was simple: the land had to be within five hours of a capital city, surrounded by nature and mountains, classified as residential or agricultural land, and have access to water, electricity, and plumbing. It also needed to be accessible by a public road. When Rio started building a tiny house during COVID lockdown, moving 3,000 kilometres across the continent wasn't on the cards. Finding a block of land that met all my requirements was easier said than done. Perth was out of the question. The Northern Territory and Queensland felt too remote, and land in New South Wales was either overpriced or had building restrictions that meant it was suitable only for camping. Then in April 2023, I found the perfect block in a small country town called Carrieton, located on Nukunu land in South Australia. Four hours from Adelaide and one hour from Port Augusta, the land cost only $10,000 \u2014 well within my budget. As soon as I saw the online listing for the 1000sqm land, I was sold. I decided I didn't need to see it in person and jumped. The tiny town of Carrieton in South Australia is an hour from Port Augusta and south of the Flinders Ranges.(Supplied: Tim Froling outbackexposures.com.au) Once I took the plunge, the actual process of purchasing the block became a daunting experience that I was completely unprepared for. The entire transaction took place online, which made me anxious. I was dealing with people in a different state, meaning different regulations, and for the first time in my life, I was making an adult purchase that would change the trajectory of my life. This was nothing like spending $50 at a restaurant or on a dress to treat myself. I constantly questioned my judgement: Have I lost my mind? What am I doing? Am I being serious, or just hopelessly naive? Is this a scam? That self-doubt lingered, but I pushed forward, driven by the promise of freedom. When my friends and family found out I had purchased the land, they were stunned and I was suddenly flooded with questions like \"What are you going to build?\" and \"How will you make it work?\" Their curiosity was both validating and intimidating, underscoring the enormity of what I had committed to. Had I bitten off more than I could chew? Absolutely! Buying land in the middle of nowhere comes with significant challenges, especially when the goal is to live there full-time or turn it into a short-term rental. These are challenges I have yet to work out. Logistics such as building permits, designs, arranging shipments and funds, and accessing basic amenities are all ahead of me. The relative isolation of a small town doesn't worry me. And owning my own land in Carrieton is a declaration of freedom.(Supplied: Tim Froling outbackexposures.com.au) But the benefits of owning something are undeniable; I've created a foundation for myself, a safety net that offers both stability and independence. I've been able to shift my focus from worrying about my future to imagining the possibilities ahead. Owning this land is my declaration of freedom. Am I worried about being isolated? Not at all. Living with a disability and being excluded from society teaches you a tough lesson: if you let isolation define you, you'll always be treading water, barely keeping your head above the surface. It comes down to a choice: keep begging for a seat at the table, or make your own rules.

While some couples take a divide and conquer approach based on strengths or schedules, for others, aroster or spreadsheethelps get things done. There are also circumstances in which \u2014 intentional or not \u2014 one personshoulders the bulk of responsibilities. We spoke to four people about the different ways they handle chore splitting in their home. Claire Jensen, 38, Townsville/Gurrumbilbarra, married with three teenagers How do you split the household chores? I have a lot of health issues and work long hours through the week. My husband Chris cooks every night and does a lot of the cleaning through the week. He also helps with organising our children's support workers and appointments. I know my husband is not the norm though. I do all the clothes washing on the weekends, and any other jobs that have been missed through the week. On school holidays I do deep cleaning of some areas. How we manage the chores has evolved over time due to my decline in health. What would you like to change, if anything? I think we have a system that works for us most of the time. How are chores divided in your household? We'd love to hear more perspectives:lifestyle@abc.net.au Gray says one housemate is in charge of mowing the lawns.(Pexels) Gray, 38, Brisbane/Meanjin. Lives in a share house with their partner and teenage son, and three other adults How do you split the household chores? We have myself, my partner and my teenage kid living on the top level and three adults on the bottom level. Each level has a bathroom, but we share the only kitchen upstairs and office space, and have a shared laundry downstairs. We take care of the main upstairs and the other three do downstairs. We have one housemate who does the lawn. He enjoys doing it. Some of us are more proactive than others. I tend to not be great at tidying and leave things like paperwork and clothes on surfaces and chairs, but I do a lot of the deep cleans. The dishes stay under control since I purchased a sliding dirty/clean magnet for the dishwasher. My teenager keeps his room clean, does his bedding, and washes his clothes. My partner and I tend to try and split the cleaning but depending on how stressed we are sometimes that falls harder on one person. Our spreadsheet to divide the mental load worked for more than a year, until significant life changes led us to take a different approach. What would you like to change about the arrangement, if anything? I'd probably get my teenager to pitch in more. He has always kept his room spotless and has been doing his own washing since he was about seven. That seemed so great for his age, I think I just never pushed him harder to help more. I'd love a regimented cleaning schedule for us to stick to. It would help me, too. Samantha and Dusko's 14-year-old daughter helps with the housework.(Supplied) Samantha Popovski, 39, Brisbane/Meanjin, married with one teenager How do you split the household chores? My husband Dusko is in charge of the outside \u2014 maintain the pool, mowing lawns, putting the bins out. He is also the \"finance minister\" of the house, as he calls himself. I used to be in charge of paying bills, but always forgot to do it. I'm in charge of the inside \u2014 cooking, washing, shopping. Things like floors, dishes, and the bathroom are alternated. We do most of our cleaning before guests come over, so split things that need doing. Our 14-year-old daughter is responsible for unloading the dishwasher and helps with washing. She vacuums and cooks about once a week. Weaponised incompetence in relationships can keep women \"locked into\" traditional roles, experts say. What would you like to change, if anything? I'm pretty happy with the way it is mostly, but I do feel like the coordinator of it all and have to ask Dusko to do things sometimes. I also have trouble giving up control of certain things because I don't trust anyone to do it the way I like. I'm trying to be better at letting go. When I'm away they both seem to survive. Kylie Bartlett says she is proud her kids have grown up watching mum and dad share chores.(Supplied) Kylie Bartlett, 48, Sunshine Coast, married with four children, two teens living at home How do you split the household chores? We share everything. If something needs doing, one of us will get it done. If anything, my husband Sean does more than me. He's the one that cooks dinner every night and does the groceries, and does all the gross chores, like cleaning the toilets and bathrooms. I do most of the laundry because I have a system and I enjoy it. I make the bed because I like the way I do it better. I love a good spring clean. Our kids have always had chores to do and so everyone does something whether it's the dishwasher or feeding the animal \u2014 we all just get on with it. We are proud that our kids have grown up seeing both mum and dad doing the chores and that chores are a part of life. While they're not that fun, they still need doing. When the kids were younger, I felt a huge pressure from society to be that super woman/wife/mum so I'd be prepping meals for the week. I was the main cook, I did the bulk of the care giving, bath times, bedtimes, and housekeeping as a stay-at-home mum. Then over the past 10 or so years I've had injuries, and then cancer, which made it impossible for me to do much at all. Sean had to step right up and take on my roles. What would you like to change about the arrangement, if anything? The only thing I want to work on now that I'm healthy again is getting back into cooking. I love cooking. I'd like to try reclaim my love for it, and also my recipes that Sean has used over the years\u2026 and dare I say improved. But the rest of the chores he can keep, if he wants.",

If a business is facing elevated costs on a particular day, they can impose a surcharge.(ABC Lifestyle: Jo Joyce) \"We've seen everything go up, from wage costs to superannuation to workers compensation, which adds \u2026 nearly 20 to 30 per cent on top of the payroll,\" says Mr Edwards, based at Port Macquarie/Birpai land on the New South Wales Mid-North Coast. \"Then things like electricity have gone up, [wholesale] coffee's tripled in price over the last 12 months. Chris Tate is the operations manager of a coffee-roasting business in North Ryde, New South Wales, on the traditional lands of the Wallumedegal people. He sayswages often equate to 35 to 40 per centof total costs and those costs spike on weekends due to penalty rates. \"The surcharge is how venues can honour those award wages without cutting hours, lowering quality, or closing on weekends,\" he says. \"It's a direct link between customers wanting a weekend coffee and making sure the person behind the machine is paid properly.\" Weekend surcharges aren't about boosting profits, they're helping cafes survive, Mr Tate says. \"There's no strict percentage cap on weekend surcharges,\" he explains, butcustomers shouldn't be surprised when they go to pay. He adds that charging fairly and communicating that to customers is key. Cafe operations manager Chris Tate says wages are one of the biggest costs for venues.(Supplied) While state or territory regulations on the way surcharges must be displayed may differ slightly, under Australian Consumer Law, businesses must: That means displaying it onprinted menus, digital ordering pages, or signageand making sure it'seasy to read. \"Anything misleading could breach ACCC (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission) guidelines,\" says Mr Tate, \"so clarity is key\". \"Most customers are understanding when you communicate openly and respectfully.\" Mr Edwards believes it would be rare that a cafe is price gouging. Industry insiders say coffee lovers \u2014 even in regional Australia \u2014 are unlikely to escape paying more for their flat whites. \"I think at the moment everyone's in a tight spot,\" he says. \"There's a lot of real costs, and I think people have just got to relate it back to their own lifestyle and their own house and the cost they're feeling as well. Mr Tate saysthe surcharge only works when it's paired with a great experience. \"If a customer is paying a little more \u2026 they should get more in return such as better service, delicious coffee, and a warm, welcoming atmosphere.\" Customers who believe they've been hit with undisclosed surcharges can make a complaint with theirlocal fair trading or consumer affairs agency.",

        "raw_text": "Getting clothes and linen dry in constant wet weather can be frustrating. Maybe you don't have the luxury of a tumble dryer, or you're reluctant to use it to save on your next power bill. Add a sudden drop in temperature and the process of drying our washing can become even tricker. Some experts, like Lish Fejer, a science communicator and ABC reporter in Ngambri/Canberra, discourage the use of tumble dryers because of the amount of energy they consume and the impact they can have on your clothes. \"[Tumble] drying is bad for your clothes; it wears them down,\" Lish says. Lish runsThe Fix It Chickswith co-creator Jenny Edwards, teaching people cheap ways to wash and dry laundry. Here are some of the alternative methods you can use for drying clothes and linen in wet or cold weather. If the clothes can withstand it (avoid wool, linens and silks, for example), put them on ahigh-spin cycle in the washing machine, and repeat. \"You can give drying a head start by spinning to get rid of as much water as possible,\" Lish says. Humidity can be an issue when drying clothes inside as excess moisture can cause mould and mildew.(Adobe Stock) When you take your clothes out of the washing machine, she suggestsrolling them up in a clean, dry towelto remove excess moisture. Lish says when using a rack for air drying, make sure theclothes are spaced out wellso air can circulate around each item. Using pegs means you won't have to fold the items over. \"Look atany glass or window that is being hit by the sun\u2014 put your drying rack there, that will activate the drying process,\" Lish says. If heading out for the day, hang sheets and towels over chairs and tables. \"I love a coat hanger;I hang shirts on them and put them over door framesand architraves.\" Ventilation is important to minimise condensation and avoid mould. \"Humidity in the house is a big one [if drying clothes indoors],\" says Lish. \"How do you get rid of that moisture in your house without it causing mould and mildew and the health effects that come with that?\" She recommendsopening a windowto manage this (weather dependent). You can also increase air flow indoors byusing a pedestal or ceiling fanwhich Lish says uses little energy and helps with evaporation. Theextraction fan in your bathroomwill be effective when drying in there. Somesplit-system air conditioners have a \"dry mode\"which can act as adehumidifier, taking moisture out of the air. Drying happens best outside, so if you have the space, take advantage. If its overcast or rainy, using a balcony or undercover area is ideal \u2014 even if shady and cold. Awindy dayis a bonus, as items will dry faster. If you're strapped for time (or motivation), throw the wet load of washing onto an outdoor table on a towel in the sun, on a picnic blanket, on the trampoline, or on the heated floor. For small items, Lish lays themon a towel in the back of her carand parks it in the sun while at work. \"You do have to occasionally go turn them over, and I leave the windows open a little.\" If you have ahot water systemin the cupboard, you could also fold clothes that are nearly dry and place them on top. \"Be careful not to cover the pressure valve,\" warns Lish. Lish says tothrow in a clean, dry towel with your wet items. \"That will significantly reduce the amount of time it needs to be on for as it absorbs some of the moisture.\" Susan Toft, the CEO and founder of a nationwide domestic laundry business, says the biggest mistake people make is simply \"putting items in that are not meant for the dryer, because you can damage them\". \"Wool, in particular, will shrink. And that's probably the thing we see the most,\" she says. But, she says, you should alsotake great care with bras, other delicate items(such as anything with silk), and clothing with prints on it. \"The best tip is to always follow the care label,\" she says. Consumer advocacy group CHOICE also advises caution when drying anything with lycra in it \u2014 so throwing in your activewear might not be the best bet. But if you do end up shrinking something, it's not the end of the world. For jumpers, you canwet them and pat them out with towels to try and stretch them back out, and then leave them to dry in a shady spot.",

        "raw_text": "Is car parking a source of contention on your street? Maybe it's hard to find a spot, there's a neighbour who parks too close to your driveway, or caravans are being parked for long periods. If you want to tackle your parking problems, here are some things to consider. Parking issues are common across Australia, including in suburbanAdelaideandgrowing regional towns. Louise Crawford is the Mayor of Port Phillip Council in Naarm/Melbourne, where parking can be tricky to come by \u2014 depending on the street. \"We're incredibly limited in the amount of parking spaces that we have,\" she says. Estelle Grech says it's important that people aren't using \"public space like their personal garage\".(Supplied: Committee for Sydney) Katy Woods, a senior lawyer with Legal Aid NSW on Gadigal land in Sydney, says the organisation \"regularly get calls about drivers who park outside another person's home or over someone's driveway\". Estelle Grech is the policy manager at the Committee for Sydney, an urban policy think tank. In some instances, she says parking shortages are \"perceived\" because it's assumed changes or development in the area always equates to less parking. She says more housing needs to be planned near public transport so car space availability is less of an issue and people can choose not to have a car. Ms Woods recommends people contact their council if they're \"consistently unable to park outside their home\". She says most New South Wales councils have online forms to raise parking grievances. If you live in an apartment, Ms Woods suggests raising the issue with your strata manager instead. Ms Grech says expecting a park outside your home is not realistic in every area. \"People need to remember that they don't own the street outside their house as well,\" she says. However, she adds \"it makes sense to have a park ideally reserved directly outside your house\" if you have mobility issues. Different Australian states and cities have a process to apply for anaccessibility parking permit,mobility parking permitoran equivalent. The eligibility requirements and processes differ, but mobility limitation caused by a medical condition, injury or disability are common prerequisites. Additionally, Cr Crawford saysPort Philip Councilhas a process for accessibility parking permit holders to request an accessible on-street parking space outside their home. The process is similar in other areas, and you can check with your local council. Cr Crawford says a \"polite conversation\" with your neighbour is warranted if their parking is obstructing driveways. Katy Woods says its best to seek legal advice before taking any legal action.(Supplied: Legal Aid NSW) While leaving an anonymous note on their windscreen might be tempting, Ms Woods says it's \"unlikely to resolve the issue\". \"Be respectful, and keep in mind that there may be personal circumstances, such as mobility issues or illness, that your neighbours are dealing with.\" If you can't resolve the issue, a mediation service could be the next step. Mediation facilitators can be found online. Mis Woods says legal action should be a last resort and if you are ever \"concerned for your safety, contact the police and seek advice about obtaining an [apprehended violence order]\". Cr Crawford says that if driveway access is blocked, council can also tow the offending vehicles, which happens about four to five times a week in her area. Ms Woods also says, if a car is blocking the driveway of causing a hazard you can report it to police. Louise Crawford says increasing the number of permits in an area doesn't create more space for car parks.(Supplied: Port Phillip Council) The rules covering street parking differ from council to council and often vary drastically from street to street. In Port Phillip Council, Cr Crawford says the permit system has been tightened. She says at one stage there was a family that had eight residential parking permits. She says parking permits are now usually restricted to one per household for new residents. Permits also help set realistic expectations about parking availability in the area, Cr Crawford says. Cr Crawford says caravans and trailers being parked for long periods is \"becoming a greater issue\", and council is considering introducing new laws to address it. The sight of campervans, caravans, buses and trailers blocking views and parking spots is source of frustration for Gold Coast locals. \"In some areas where we don't have any parking restrictions ... people are turning them into private caravan and trailer storage areas.\" In NSW, Ms Woods says that if a vehicle is \"more than 7.5 metres long or weighs more than 4.5 tonnes, it is classified as a heavy and long vehicle\", which means there are additional rules for parking. She also recommends checking the relevant council website for information about where you can or can't park a caravan or boat trailer.",

        "raw_text": "Brooke Ferrier admittedly never paid much attention to her weekly grocery bill. But sticking to a budget became a reality for the New South Wales Central Coast mother of two when she and her husband both lost their jobs. \"There was a lot going on in my personal life and I really didn't have the capacity to think about what to cook,\" Ms Ferrier recalled. \"I thought I'd turn to AI [artificial intelligence] and see if it could help me out in terms of creating a bit of a meal plan on a budget.\" She asked ChatGPT for a low-cost meal plan for two adults and two toddlers and followed up with extra instructions (known as prompts in the AI world) to fine-tune the result, including a request for hidden vegetables, low-carb options and no lentils, to meet the family's preferences. Ms Ferrier says AI gives her one recipe to feed the whole family, with variations to meet individual needs.(Supplied: Brooke Ferrier) The AI also compared supermarket prices and created a categorised shopping list with specific quantities. The result was a week's worth of breakfasts, dinners and snacks coming in at a total of $140. It was a drastic difference to the way Ms Ferrier used to shop. \"[Previously] I'd get a range of different meats, a whole bunch of veggies and fruit and our pantry and our fridge were stocked but I was spending $400 or $500 every four or five days,\" she said. The Ferriers have drastically changed the way they shop.(ABC South East SA: Josh Brine) \"Each night I was making what came to mind looking into the fridge, no thought or planning to what we were eating. \"I was always over cooking and always throwing out waste. The family's weekly meal plans include spaghetti bolognese with hidden veggies, chicken and veg stir-fry, beef and vegetable meatballs and homemade snacks. Pho is one of the new recipes in the Ferriers' weekly meal plans.(Supplied: Brooke Ferrier) Ms Ferrier said she was now making meals go further. \"I had been one to buy things out of ease, to feed the kids, things like processed snacks,\" she said. \"[But] when I cook there are always leftovers \u2026 a lot of the meals can serve as snacks later \u2026 [things like] fritters, pancakes, sausage rolls. \"One week, I typed in that we'd been feeling sick and wanted foods that are meant to boost immunity.\" She has also asked AI for recipes to use up pantry items that have been in the cupboard for a long time, like tinned tomatoes and coconut milk. Food and nutrition scientist Emma Beckett said there was almost no downside to using AI for meal planning, but warned it was important to get specific about what you wanted. \"I would add some prompts around things like making sure I had enough fibre according to the Australian Dietary Guidelines,\" Dr Beckett advised. \"To make sure we're not just eating frugally but we're also eating well and nourishing ourselves.\" Emma Beckett says the environmental impact of using AI would be offset by reducing household food waste.(Supplied: Emma Beckett) Dr Beckett said one of the reasons an AI meal plan or shopping list could save money was because it removed human emotion. \"It means you don't need to make those decisions because we are emotional in the supermarket, and the supermarkets rely on that.\" Ms Ferrier agreed that AI helped ensure she was only buying what she needed. \"We've gone from a fridge full of food all the time, to the bare minimum,\" she said. \"In the past, we were constantly throwing out quite a bit \u2026 we always had a lot of waste.\" Dr Beckett says supermarkets rely on human emotion when shoppers make decisions, but AI eliminates that.(ABC News: Courtney Withers) Ms Ferrier and her husband have both found new jobs but plan to continue using AI to help keep the budget in check. As for the weekly savings? \"That will probably go back into the kids somehow on clothes or toys,\" Ms Ferrier said. \"But we're also planning to renovate so we're looking to tighten our budget however we can.\"",

        "raw_text": "In 1971, John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono swapped their Ascot mansion and 70-acre estate for a two-room loft in New York's Greenwich Village. They threw themselves headfirst into the political and social movements of the time, helping the counterculture pick up the pieces after what Lennon perceived as the failure of the 'Flower Power' movement in the years prior. It was a significant move for arguably the most famous singer of all time. Lennon turned his back on what could have been an enviable life as part of high society and instead invested his energy and money in ensuring the youth of America didn't become apathetic in the quest for non-violence and equality. \"I'm happy as Larry,\" Lennon said at the time. \"I feel like a student again. We're like a young married couple.\" The only full concert John Lennon played after the break-up of The Beatles is a key part of this new documentary about his life with Yoko Ono in the early 1970s.(Supplied: Sydney Film Festival) One To One: John and Yoko is a fascinating, fast-paced collage of old footage and taped phone conversations that take us inside the couples' movements at this time. The phone calls are particularly compelling as we hear the couple scheming, cycling through a variety of causes, seemingly aching for places they can lend their celebrity clout to raise awareness. There are a few recurring narratives throughout that keep us engrossed. One of them involves capturing thousands of live flies for a Yoko Ono art exhibit, another sees them convince infamous Bob Dylan stalker A. J. Weberman to back off his target, while there are chilling moments where Lennon \u2014 who was shot dead in 1980 \u2014 ruminates about becoming a target when appearing at key demonstrations. Another through line revolves around the only full-length concert John Lennon gave after The Beatles's split and before his death. The concert, which happened across two sessions at Madison Square Garden in 1972, was a benefit for the children of the Willowbrook School \u2014 an institution caring for children with intellectual disabilities. Footage from the show is great, but even more interesting is learning how the couple arrived at the idea to play the show. Because there are so many individual examples of John and Yoko's activism, it makes for a fast-paced video diary with a frenetic energy that perhaps speaks to the couple's own chaotic momentum. \"I thought: There's enough here that we could just let them speak for themselves, allow the audience to eavesdrop on them and allow that to be part of the fun of the film,\" director Kevin Macdonald said in publicity materials around the film. \"I think that's much more interesting than a traditional biopic, where the filmmakers are trying to present a very coherent version of things. As we all know, life is chaotic and contradictory.\" Even if your interest in John and Yoko themselves is negligible, the film will still offer a captivating snapshot of the social and political climate of the time. Whether it's Carole Feraci'sprotest against Richard Nixon, therailing against inhumane conditionsat Attica State prison, or the case of poet John Sinclair, who wasjailed for 10 years for cannabis possession, the film covers plenty of historical moments that paint a riveting picture of the counterculture of the time. And people with a love for old New York City will revel in the way the film plops us right in that space and time. The treatment of Yoko Ono by Lennon's adoring fans and even his Beatles band mates is laid bare in some confronting conversations, where the artist bluntly recounts the comments and violence she'd been subjected to. Speaking of violence, Lennon's past behaviours are only vaguely hinted at. The takeaway message is that the John Lennon of the early 70s was a more enlightened man than the one who grew up scrapping in Liverpool and was violent towards his first wife, Cynthia, in the 1960s. \"I fell in love with an independent, eloquent, outspoken, creative genius,\" Lennon says at one point. \"I started waking up.\" While there may be a touch of hagiography about One To One, it's a rare example of a John Lennon documentary that offers something many fans might not have seen or even known about before. As far as history lessons go, it's totally compelling. As we learned in the eight-hour 2021 documentary Get Back, which took us inside the recording of The Beatles's final album, being a fly on the wall for historical moments is a captivating prospect. This film moves far quicker, but the same idea applies: we're always shown what John and Yoko do rather than merely told about it. \"Very early on, I decided I wasn\u2019t going to try and chase old men on their deathbeds to get their last John Lennon anecdote \u2014 which they've probably told before,\" director Macdonald said. One To One: John & Yoko is a truly intimate capture of what drove this couple at a key point in their life, and how their very presence at this key moment had an impact on the countercultural movement of the time. One To One: John & Yoko screens at the Sydney Film Festival this weekend.",

        "raw_text": "With so many Australians doing big things in K-pop, a key question is why. How is it that Australia has produced so many homegrown K-pop stars? This is something Roald Maliangkay from the Australian National University has pondered. Roald Maliangkay is the Deputy Director of the Korea Institute at the Australian National University (ANU).(Supplied) And yes, he is named after the late decorated British children's author Roald Dahl. Professor Maliangkay specialises in popular culture in East Asia and has researched the South Korean entertainment industry throughout the 20thcentury up to the present day. He's come up with a few reasons why Australia is fertile ground for producing K-pop stars. \"I think one important reason is that a lot of the Korean Australians here speak Korean, maybe not well, but they are fairly recent migrants,\" Professor Maliangkay said. \"It's usually their parents who migrate to Australia and that means that their parents will speak Korean at home. \"I think that's one important reason so that makes it very likely for the trainees, which they are at first, to at least be familiar with the sounds so they can pick up Korean quite easily even if they didn't always speak Korean at home or outside in public. \"So, I think the language aspect is quite significant.\" Professor Maliangkay says demographics plays a part. \"Of course, we are a very small country in terms of population but if you look at cities like Sydney and Melbourne then the concentration of Asians around you will be much greater which probably provides a bit of an impetus for young people to try and establish their own identity and be noticed. \"And I think that is another driver for young Australians with an Asian background to perhaps try their luck at becoming a K-pop artist.\" \"Another factor is that communication amongst Australians tends to be rather positive,\" Professor Maliangkay said. \"People here communicate in a very positive manner. \"Australians are really good at representing themselves and in engaging in conversation so that also makes things easy for an agency. \"Australians are generally very polite, they're pleasant and they use a lot of words like fantastic, wonderful and great, which when you go to Britain that is not exactly the case.\" Professor Maliangkay says it's unlikely there are political reasons at play, but it could be a tiny factor. \"I don't think it is very likely that it's a political decision not to go with a United States-born artist,\" he said. \"But I do think that it's a little easier for Chinese fans to fall in love with a non-US based idol than it is when you're dealing with someone born in Australia. \"It's a tiny factor and the fans ultimately will fall in love anyway, but I think it might make things just a little easier.\" \"If you're a young person and you want to go to a workshop in Korea and try your luck at an audition, at the moment, the time difference between us and Seoul is one hour only,\" Professor Maliangkay said. \"So, that makes going back-and-forth even when you're in high school just a little easier. \"Again, that's a tiny reason just like the political one but the other reasons I'm more sure of, that is, the language aspect, the greater convergence of Asian Australians and then the communication and the representation of Australians in general.\" So, who has made it big and who is on their way? Blackpink's Ros\u00e9 made history when her collaboration with Bruno Mars APT debuted at number one on the ARIA singles chart making her the first solo female K-pop star to top the ARIA chart. \"She was born in New Zealand but then she was raised in Melbourne, I think from the age of seven and then she trained herself singing in church choirs,\" says Professor Maliangkay. \"She just suddenly had the courage when she was quite young, I think she was 16, to pack her bags and go to YG entertainment where she went to train, and it worked out. \"In the beginning, she was an absolute nobody, of course, and risked a lot doing all this and spending money on this. NewJeans broke a Guinness World Record when they became the fastest K-pop act to reach a billion streams on Spotify, unseating BTS. They have two Australian members. \"Danielle was born outside a big city, in Newcastle, NSW,\" Professor Maliangkay said. Danielle from NewJeans was born in Newcastle, NSW.(Supplied: Courtesy of ADOR) \"She has an Australian father and a Korean mother. \"And they moved to Korea in 2019 at around the age of 14. \"She was kind of scouted by HYBE.\" Hanni was born in Melbourne to Vietnamese parents. Hanni from NewJeans was born in Melbourne.(Supplied: Courtesy of ADOR) \"[She] moved to Seoul around 2020 at the age of 16 so that would make her 21 right now. \"She also ended up with the same company, with HYBE.\" Fans of K-pop would be aware of some recent news surrounding the multinational entertainment company HYBE. \"Although the company has responded to the recent allegations of insider trading by a former executive saying it is fully cooperating with the authorities, it denies any wrongdoing by chairman Bang Si-hyuk. \"And yet, since December, Bang has been under police investigation on suspicion of profiting by as much as $450 million from misleading shareholders during the company's listing.\" HYBE has issued the following statement to ABC News on the matter. Regarding NewJeans, Professor Maliangkay says fans were distraught to learn of a stand-off between NewJeans and parent company HYBE. \"What is more, following the public fallout over management rights with former CEO Min Hee-jin of ADOR that began in April last year, NewJeans's activities have now been put on hold, with ADOR last Friday winning an injunction against the group members engaging in any unauthorised individual entertainment activities until the legal process has run its course,\" Professor Maliangkay said. \"The idols stand by Min and argue that HYBE's reorganisation of ADOR has turned it into something very different from the label they signed with. \"Conflicts between idols and their management over contracts are not uncommon. Groups like Fifty Fifty, Loona, and TVXQ have faced serious disputes, some of which have led to their disbandment. \"While the high stakes of investment and intense competition help explain the often inequitable nature of contracts, fans typically rally behind the idols, so the companies almost always stand to lose from public disputes. \"I suspect that quite a few fans will respond to the scandals either by not investing as much money in HYBE products, or embracing the idols of other agencies, or both. \"Despite the negative reports surrounding HYBE's management, however, fans' excitement for BTS's long-awaited return \u2014 marked by SUGA's military discharge on June 21 \u2014 will likely remain undiminished.\" HYBE subsidiary ADOR has issued the following statement. \"We express our sincere gratitude for the court's judicious decision to grant the preliminary injunction.

Jake from Enhypen grew up in Brisbane.(Supplied: Courtesy of BELIFT LAB) \"Roughly after one year he was made part of Enhypen and I think they're doing quite well. \"Of course, Brisbane also has a very large Asian community, so I suppose there's a little bit of an impetus for young Asian Australians to kind of stand out a little bit and do something different, be noticed, and then of course with all trainees the lure of fame, money, fashion, and perhaps cosmetic surgery, which is definitely one of the perks, because the agencies will help you arrange that.\" Others to watch out for are Robin from n.SSign, who has debuted, and who said on TikTok that he went to the same school as Felix from Stray Kids and cites the whole group as role models.

        "raw_text": "\"All this saving the world, is it really service, duty, righteous anger, or is it just a childlike desire to be at the centre of the action?\" Bono wonders backstage at his sold-out, one-man show at New York's Beacon Theater in 2023. \"Desire and virtue is a whole dance.\" What:U2 singer Bono lays bare his life and career in a one-man stage show, part spoken-word and part solo music performance. Starring:Bono Director:Andrew Dominik Where:Streaming now on Apple TV+ Likely to make you feel:Like falling in love with U2 again \u2014 if you're a fan Across a 45-year career as a globe-straddling superstar and activist, the U2 singer has danced the fine line between rock 'n' roll icon and enduring public nuisance. He's been both the voice of one of the biggest bands of the late 20th-century and \u2014 to some, at least \u2014 a blowhard palling around with celebrities and world leaders. But as the new movie Bono: Stories of Surrender shows, there's a complicated, endearingly contradictory man behind the often-outsized public profile; one whose idealism is frequently troubled by self-doubt, and whose pursuit of stardom stems from a past steeped in loss. Filmed over several nights of his New York residency, Stories of Surrender vividly captures Bono's one-man adaptation of his best-selling 2022 memoir, Surrender, translating the book's revealing candour to the stage with the singer's typically self-reflexive humour. As he quipped to Jimmy Kimmel recently: \"I play an aging rock star on a massive ego trip.\" There are no mirror-balls or giant lemons or jumbotrons broadcasting prank calls to The White House, just a starkly lit stage and a few empty pieces of furniture to stand in for key figures in his life \u2014 including the rest of U2, who are nowhere to be found. During the show, Bono re-creates infrequent pub meetings he used to have with his late father.(Supplied: Apple TV+) It begins, as many such stories do, with a health scare that prompts a crisis of faith and life evaluation. \"How did I get here?\" Bono asks, echoing the words of his contemporary David Byrne, after an operation on his \"eccentric\" heart in 2016. Still, it's hardly a sombre opening: the star is in full-tilt carnival-barker mode, part preacher, part game-show host, a pair of wraparound shades short of his Zoo TV MacPhisto. Bono's brand of ironic bravado, in which every sincere moment is inevitably chased by a self-deprecating shot, will do little to convince detractors who regard him as the epitome of anti-cool. For U2 fans, however, it's a wonderful reminder of just how adept he is with a pithy turn of phrase or ready-made pop graffiti \u2014 he's perhaps the only songwriter to land the line \"you're turning tricks with your crucifix\" on a major motion picture soundtrack aimed at children. Bono still manages to draw power and emotion from his aging voice.(Supplied: Apple TV+) Much of Bono's humour appears to originate from his late father, Bob Hewson, a man who looms over the show despite appearing only as an empty chair and a glass of Black Bush whiskey. Playing both father and son, Bono recreates infrequent pub meetings with his Da, who remains hilariously unimpressed with his kid's success (labelling him \"a baritone who thinks he's a tenor\"), nor his phone calls from Pavarotti (Bono's impression of the Italian opera giant is among the film's funniest moments). You Can't Leave U2 Behind... Their relationship was complex. After a 14-year-old Bono lost his mother, who collapsed at his grandfather's funeral (\"It sounds almost too Irish, I know,\" he jokes), his father never spoke of her again. Her death haunted almost every aspect of the rocker's life and career. At the very same time, he would meet his future wife, Ali, and the musicians \u2014 The Edge, Larry Mullen Jr, and Adam Clayton \u2014 with whom he'd rocket to mulleted 80s stardom. The stories of U2's early adventures are invariably charming, as the teenage band fumbles about to land on their signature sound \u2014 at one point Bono urging The Edge to make his guitar \"sound like an electric drill into the ear\". It's Bono's reckoning with fame that proves to be the real revelation, however, as he and his band mates wrestle with their spiritual beliefs in the wake of new-found celebrity. The U2 frontman's brand of ironic bravado will still likely grate with the haters.(Supplied: Apple TV+) \"Fame is currency,\" Bono reasons. \"You wouldn't need charity if the world was just, so \u2014 get the cheque.\" If the humanitarian act borders on Vegas schtick, Bono is the first to admit it. \"I am an over-paid, over-regarded, over-rewarded, over-fed rock 'n' roll star,\" he says in voiceover, commenting on the action. And whenever the self-therapy pauses for a burst of music, it's hard to resist those soaring pipes, still stirring after all these years and audible wear and tear. 'With Or Without You', delivered here in thorny tribute to his wife, remains as sad and gorgeous as ever, while 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' takes on a new, ghostly power in a stripped back, slowed down performance. The movie is littered with stripped-back U2 classics and crowd favourites.(Supplied: Apple TV+) Meanwhile, U2's 1988 hit 'Desire' emerges as both a pivotal point in the band's career and a key text in Bono's life, tapping into the tension between the sacred and the profane that the band would toy with on 90s highlights Achtung Baby and Zooropa. \"For love or money, money, money,\" Bono sings, throwing theatrical shapes and channelling late-period Elvis. Even 'Beautiful Day' \u2014 arguably the beginning of U2's long decline into musical irrelevance \u2014 becomes a moving elegy for the dead, as Bono teases out the melancholy beneath the song's radio-friendly chorus. It's a lovely moment, a tribute to those we've lost and to all the strange little things that somehow keep us going along the way. Haters will burn with renewed fire, but if you've ever had a soft spot for U2, Stories of Surrender may just make you fall in love with them all over again.",

        "raw_text": "Dressed all in black with two big red flowers pinned to her chest, 11-year-old Larnisha has travelled all the way from the Northern Territory to have her voice heard in the nation's halls of power. However, the Eastern Arrernte girl has not come to the grand hall of Canberra's Parliament House to give a speech, but to sing. She's one of 1,000 singers from around Australia who gathered to sing the Anthem of the Desert Pea \u2014 a ballad about the Frontier wars, death and new life. Larnisha is singing to commemorate those who lost their lives during colonisation. For Indigenous Australians, the desert pea is a symbol similar to the Flanders poppy.(ABC News) Florist and 1,000 Voices liaison officer Hazel Davis, with the help of the Arrernte people from the Northern Territory, has committed a decade to understanding the story of the desert pea. Hazel Davis has spent the past decade learning the story of the desert pea and its place in Indigenous history.(ABC News: David Sciasci) The desert pea is a flowering plant that grows in the centre of Australia, from far west New South Wales, into South Australia and Queensland, and across into Western Australia. Ms Davies said the desert pea was a symbol of remembrance for people who have died on country, similar to the story of the Flanders poppy. Indigenous Australians are hopeful the federal government will progress a national truth telling process, despite the PM backing down from the commitment to create a national commission. \"The ancestors in the sky [witness the Frontier Wars] \u2026 they weep so much that their tears flood the land \u2026 the water flows over the bodies of the Aboriginal people,\" she said. Ms Davies said the desert pea sprouted from where the bodies lay. \"It's a flower of sorrow \u2026 it is not a replacement flower, it does not negate our powerful, rightful memorial of those who died for our country overseas. It's calling for a memorial on our own soil,\" she said. Shirleen McLaughlin was told the story of the desert pea by her grandmother in the next step of an oral history stretching generations. She was pleased the story had now been written down in a book to be recorded forever: 'The Legend of the Desert Pea' by Arrernte Elder Beverley O'Callaghan. Singers came from around Australia to perform in Parliament House.(ABC News: David Sciasci) That book inspired the anthem, composed by OZY Youth Choir co-founder OJ Rushton and Ms Davis. Ms McLaughlin, representing the Arrente people, read it to the audience at Parliament House. \"We need truth-telling and then we'll all be set free. \"I hope they acknowledge and change the future.\" This year's theme for Reconciliation Day is \"Bridging Now to Next\" and, as the singers take their places on stage, there's an undercurrent of hope that Australia's history will be remembered in its entirety. Wangkangurru Elder Uncle Raymond Finn, who travelled from the Simpson Desert, said the story of the pea helped him understand who he was. Wangkangurru Elder Uncle Raymond Finn says sharing stories is an important part of healing.(ABC News: David Sciasci) He has lost family members both on country and for country, and said the performance in parliament filled him with hope. \"To see the children today touched my heart, and I know that we're moving forward as a nation with the poppy and the pea,\" he said. Standing by Larnisha is her close friend Adelaide Page from the NSW Central Coast. The pair first met when the Ozy Youth Choir headed to the Northern Territory to learn about the desert pea. Adelaide and Larnisha's friendship blossomed when they met on country in 2023.(Supplied: Unity Light Films) Adelaide is also 11 and she's a \"poppy\" child. Her father was deployed to Iraq in 2007 and Afghanistan in 2009. She may be young, but she hopes singing her heart out in the halls of parliament will pave the way for a better future. Best friends Larnisha and Adelaide sang their hearts out at Parliament House.(ABC News: David Sciasci)",

I see a number of posts about the strength of the Australian dollar (against the weakening US dollar).  On the flip side, why is the Australian dollar so weak against the British Pound?! - Theo GreetingsTheoand thanks for joining us from your UK holiday! Perhaps it was wise to check the blog instead of your currency conversion rate to keep holiday spirits high\u2026 I jest, but it isn't tracking too well. The Australian dollar is currently buying around 47.76 British pence. Here's how it's tracked since the start of 2025: As luck would have it,CBA's Kristina Cliftonfeatured this very topic in her morning note today \u2014 unfortunately, it isn't great news for travellers to the UK, withthe Aussie expected to track \"broadly sideways over 2025\", and if there is a risk, it's to the downside: \"AUD/GBP has fallen by over 3 per cent so far this yearand is currently trading around 12 per cent below its five-year average of 0.5372. \"However,we judge that that the fundamentals justify the heavy AUD/GBP. \"The two-year differential between Australian and UK government bonds has fallen further into negative territory this year, a headwind for AUD/GBP. \"Continued high inflation in the UK has caused markets to pare back expectations for Bank of England interest rate cuts. \"At the same time the RBA has become more dovish causing markets o price more cuts. \"Australia'scommodity prices have eased and measures of market risk have increased modestly, also weighing on AUD/GBP. \"Looking ahead we expect AUD/GBP to broadly track sideways over 2025. \"However, AUD/GBPcould be weaker than we expect if there is another major disturbance to the global economic outlook.\" Sorry to be the bearer of bad news on the exchange rate front Theo, but here's hoping you'll be too busy enjoying your holiday to give it much thought. By Stephanie Chalmers Australians are losing millions of dollars each year to scams linked to cryptocurrency ATMs. Financial crime and money-laundering regulator AUSTRAC has announced new controls on crypto ATM operators, including $5,000 transaction limits.

By Stephanie Chalmers Shares in education provider IDP Education crashed this session, hitting an all-time low at one point during Tuesday's trade. As we approach the close in about an hour's time, the stock is down 45 per cent, which leaves itnearly 68 per cent lower since January 1, after it warned that theuncertainty around immigration policy globally was hitting the international student market. \"This update clearlyhighlights the significant challenges for the companyin [the second half], particularly for the Student Placement business, withvolumes expected to be well below our estimatesfor [the current financial year], with the decline accelerating slightly in [the second half],\"E&P analyst Entcho Raykovskiwrote in a note. By Adelaide Miller Iron ore futures has slipped to its lowest in nearly two months, thanks to fears sparked by US President Donald Trump's plan to double the tariffs on steel imports to 50 per cent. According to Reuters, the most-traded September iron ore contract on China's Dalian Commodity Exchange ended morning trade 0.92% lower at 697 yuan ($150.60) a metric ton. The contract hit its lowest since April 10 at 690.5 yuan a ton earlier in the session. On Friday, Trump announced his plan to increase tariffs on imported steel and aluminum to 50%, up from 25%, exacerbating already existing trade war pressures. On Monday, US prices of steel and aluminium spiked, while shares of foreign steelmakers dropped. Chinese markets, however, were closed on Monday due to a public holiday. Despite the current 90-day pause, the ongoing tariff war between China and the US has impacted the Chinese manufacturing sector, casting a shadow on steel's demand outlook. The manufacturing sector has taken the lead as the country's biggest steel consumer, ahead of infrastructure and real estate. By Adelaide Miller Despite super fund HESTA being back online, consumers have told the ABC they are struggling to get through to the customer service team. One woman told the ABC she has been phoning HESTA for three days with no luck. HESTA's website states it is \"experiencing high call volumes\". By Stephanie Chalmers RBA's Sarah Hunterhas outlined the \"key transmission channels\" the central bank has identified forhow recent developments in the US trade war will flow through to the global economy and affect Australia, during a speech in Brisbane: \"Trade flows between countries are likely to realign, and over time multinational businesses could start moving production to different countries. \"Households and businesses in the countries that apply tariffs are likely to change what they consume, as some products become relatively more expensive, and as prices change more generally. \"Until it's clearer where policy will settle, businesses and households are likely to become (understandably) more cautious, and potentially delay major decisions such as capital investment. \"Fiscal and monetary policy can respond, potentially helping to offset adverse impacts. \"Financial markets will respond by repricing all assets including equities, bonds, commodity prices and exchange rates. These moves impact financial conditions, which further impact firms' and households' decisions.\" By Stephanie Chalmers Reserve Bank assistant governor (economic) Sarah Hunteris delivering a speech in Brisbane. It's titled \"Joining the dots: exploring Australia's economic links with the world economy\", so pretty timely you'd have to say. She opens with the Lenin quote, \"There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen\". \"It certainly feels like the last few months fit into the latter category. \"The broad-based nature of the proposed US tariffs, retaliation from major partners and other policy shifts all have the potential to structurally alter the world economy.\" By Reuters Australia's current account deficit narrowed in the first quarterdriven by changes in financial flows, whilenet exports proved to be a small drag on growth, painting a somewhat sombre picture for the economy at the start of the year. Other data also showed government spending, which has been driving economic growth, would drag a little on growth, although inventories surprised on the upside, adding a bit to gross domestic product (GDP). The current account ran a deficit of $14.7 billion in the first quarter, against a revised shortfall of $16.3 billion the previous quarter, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed. That was driven mostly by financial flows, with net exports subtracting 0.1 percentage point from GDP in the first quarter, the ABS said. Analysts had expected a flat contribution. Combined with the weakness in business investment, most of the data suggests some downside risks for the Australian economy. Analysts are tipping the economy would grow just 0.4 per cent in the first quarter, slowing from the 0.6 per cent gain previously. Annual growth was seen picking up to 1.5 per cent, from 1.3 per cent. \"Today's data together with recent soft data on retail sales and capex, mean tomorrow's Q1 GDP release is likely to show that activity was subdued in the first quarter,\" saidBen Udy, lead economist forOxford Economics Australia. \"Data on inventories suggests they may have been a rare bright spot in the Q1 activity data.\" The economic outlook has been clouded by rising global trade risks and a stubbornly frugal consumer, despite lower borrowing costs and a cooling in inflation, which has had investors betting on a further rate cut in July. The Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to 3.85 per cent last month as cooling inflation at home offered scope to counter global trade risks, and opened the door to more policy easing ahead. Minutes from the May policy meeting showed policymakers considered cutting rates by an outsized 50 basis points. Markets imply around a 70 per cent chance the RBA will ease again at its next meeting on July 8, though most analysts assume the central bank will wait for inflation data for the second-quarter to be released later in the month before deciding in August.

It is currently negative in year-on-year terms. \"We note the RBA's productivity forecast sits at an optimistic ~1% for most of its forecast horizon to mid-2027. This is consistent with our view that it is not wages growth that is key for the RBA but [unit labour costs]. \"They are easing and we will likely see that continue in Q1 national accounts tomorrow but will still be elevated, probably above 4%. \"Coupled with a labour market that still errs tight, this argues against RBA policy settings moving to the easy side of neutral and consistent with our base case for two more cuts this year.\" By Stephanie Chalmers Consider this \u2014 you try to log into your bank account to move some money around to pay a bill. When you go to log in, you can't. You really need that cash. There's a message at the top of the website \u2014 your bank is upgrading its system. You won't be able to log in to your account for seven weeks. You can't withdraw any of your money, other than in exceptional circumstances. Of course, this isn't a real story about a major Australian bank. That would be ridiculous, right? Surely no-one would accept their bank going offline for nearly two months, even if it was with the promise of a better experience for customers on the other side. And presumably the regulators would have something to say.

        "raw_text": "Millions of Australian workers will get a 3.5 per cent pay rise from July 1, following the Fair Work Commission's (FWC) annual review of the minimum wage and award agreements. The commission's decision increases the national minimum wage to $24.95 per hour or $948 per week, based on a full-time, 38-hour working week. Inflation is currently at 2.4 per cent annually. While the national minimum wage covers a small proportion of the workforce, about a fifth of all employees in Australia are paid at a minimum award rate. Workers reliant on award wages are disproportionately female and more than half are employed casually, while two-thirds work part-time hours and more than a third are low paid. This means the wages paid to award workers only make up 10.5 per cent of the national \"wage bill\", the FWC noted. Award workers are concentrated in the accommodation and food services, health care and social assistance, retail trade, and administrative and support services sectors. William Seamons, a corporate security guard based in regional Victoria, described the increase as \"awesome\". William Seamons will see his pay increase after the annual ruling.(ABC News: Emilia Terzon) Mr Seamons is paid under the security level 5 award rate and expects to see his pay increase by just over $1 an hour. \"The industry does need a pay rise\u2026 it's overdue and it'll make a difference for a lot of people,\" he said. The above-inflation wages rise addresses some of the decline in real wages experienced by minimum wage and award wage workers in recent years. \"The principal decision which has guided our decision is the fact that, since July 2021, the real value of modern award wages \u2026 has declined by 4.5 percentage points relative to inflation,\" the review read. The FWC said at its last three annual decisions, it put off taking action to reverse the decline in real wages \"out of a concern that this might result in the further persistence of higher inflation\". It said with inflation now back within the Reserve Bank's 2-3 per cent target range, it has now taken the opportunity to go some of the way to correcting the decline in real wages. \"We are concerned that if this opportunity is not taken in this Review, the loss in the real value of wages which has occurred will become permanently embedded in the modern award system, and the [national minimum wage] and a reduction in living standards for the lowest paid in the community will thereby be entrenched,\" the decision stated. Hospitality, health and social services, retail and admin workers are particularly reliant on award wages.(AAP: Alan Porritt, file photo) The FWC ruling was announced today after lobbying from various groups. The federal government had argued for an \"economically sustainable real wage increase\" \u2014 while not putting a firm figure on its request, it indicated support for a wage rise above inflation. Following the decision, Employment Minister Amanda Rishworth said it was \"consistent\" with what the government had called for in its submission. \"This represents a real wage increase to close to 3 million workers right across this country. \"It will mean, for those on the minimum wage, for those working full-time, a close to a $1,700 annual increase.\" Productivity is dominating headlines, but is it really possible to measure in Australia? Business groups including the Australian Retailers Association and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry had called for no more than 2.5 per cent, arguing any more would put too much pressure on employers. Australian Industry Group was slightly higher at 2.6 per cent. Meanwhile, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) had lobbied for a rise of up to 4.5 per cent. ACTU secretary Sally McManus welcomed the FWC decision, describing it as a \"great outcome\". \"It's 1.1 per cent more than inflation, so it means that, finally, award wage workers in Australia \u2014 our lowest-paid workers \u2014 are getting ahead again,\" she told a press conference. \"The Fair Work Commission accepted the arguments made by unions that it was time for low-wage workers, award workers, to start catching up for what was lost during the inflation spike.\" The Council of Small Business Organisations Australia (COSBOA) said small businesses would be the ones footing the bill for the wage increase. \"Small businesses are facing a cost crisis across energy, rent, insurance and input costs,\" COSBOA chief executive Luke Achterstraat said. \"Today's decision of a 3.5 per cent increase, which is above the current rate of inflation, will have ramifications for our small business engine room, many of whom are struggling to make a profit on already razor-thin margins. \"For every dollar increase in the award rate, employers also face higher levels of workers compensation, payroll tax and, of course, another legislated increase in the superannuation guarantee from July 1.\" John Buchanan from the University of Sydney Business School described it as a \"disappointing but pretty predictable\" outcome. Professor Buchanan said the FWC had \"offered a modest real wage increase this year after presiding over real wage cuts since 2021\". \"They also noted continuing to hold wages down will not help overcome the productivity problem,\" he told ABC News. \"In their minds they've trodden a middle path \u2014 not catching up completely but, equally, not holding back until aggregate productivity picks up.\" Westpac economists have maintained their forecast of wage inflation of 3.4 per cent mid-year, easing to 3.1 per cent by December. \"A softer labour market will see weaker wages growth from individual bargaining arrangements, offsetting a lift from enterprise bargaining and a slower moderation in award/minimum wages,\" senior economist Justin Smirk wrote. TheFWC boosted the minimum wage and awards by 3.75 per cent last year,after higher inflation pushed real wage growth further down in comparison.",

        "summary": "The amount of uncertainty in the global economy about Donald Trump's tariffs has contributed to a weaker outlook for Australia's economy, a Reserve Bank official says. Assistant governor Sarah Hunter said Australia was unlikely to face direct negative impacts.",
        "raw_text": "Australia's economy will experience weaker growth, lower inflation and a slightly weaker labour market as a consequence of US President Donald Trump's tariffs, an RBA official says. Sarah Hunter, an assistant governor at the Reserve Bank, said the uncertainty caused by Mr Trump's tariffs \u2014 with their constantly shifting rules and levels \u2014 was also making it harder to forecast where the global economy was heading. She said Australia's economy, at this point, probably would not suffer a material direct negative impact from the tariffs. The greatest uncertainty overhanging the global economy is America, once the bedrock of global financial stability. But the uncertainty sparked by the tariffs would hurt Australia, and our economy would be hit in other indirect ways, she said. She said that explained why the RBA revised its official forecasts recently to anticipate weaker growth, lower inflation and a slightly higher unemployment rate over the next 12 months. \"Global uncertainty may weigh substantially on domestic activity if uncertainty remains elevated,\" she warned. She said the RBA Board's decision tocut interest rateslast month was also informed by this analysis of the problems that flowed from heightened uncertainty in the global economy. She made her commentsin a speechto the Economic Society of Australia Queensland on Tuesday afternoon. Ms Hunter said uncertainty was \"a bit of a slippery concept\" and there were lots of ways to try to measure it. She said one way \u2014 the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU) \u2014 was based on the number of news articles that mentioned policy uncertainty. Another way \u2014 the volatility index (VIX) \u2014 was a measure that captured how uncertain financial markets were about near-term equity prices. But she said both of those indices saw a sharp rise in uncertainty after Donald Trump's tariff announcement in April, although the VIX has declined in recent weeks. See the graph below. Both measures of uncertainty rose sharply after Donald Trump announced his sweeping tariffs. And she said there was \"ample evidence\" that higher uncertainty could lead to declines in investment, output and employment and Australia was not immune from that dynamic. \"Typically, higher uncertainty leads firms to delay decisions that are costly to reverse, like investment and hiring,\" she said. \"This makes sense intuitively because there is value in waiting to see how things are playing out before making a decision that is (at least partially) non-reversible. The RBA decreases the cash rate by 0.25 of a percentage point, to 3.85 per cent. It is the second cut to rates this year, providing some further relief to home loan borrowers. \"Some studies find higher uncertainty also has a measurable impact on household consumption, but this is typically more modest. \"Research suggests that the negative impacts of higher policy uncertainty \u2014 including trade policy \u2014 are largest for businesses, as they typically pull back on investment,\" she said. She said that if we saw businesses and households responding as they had in the past, then the current level of uncertainty \"will weigh materially on global activity\". \"But the unpredictability and unprecedented nature of the current situation makes it hard to be precise on the size of the impact,\" she warned. She said at this stage, the RBA's \"baseline scenario\" for its official forecasts assumed that the prevailing level of global uncertainty would have a \"relatively modest drag\" on Australia's economy. But she said if a global trade war erupted, we could see a \"substantial pull-back in activity\" in Australia. Overall, Ms Hunter said the RBA would monitor carefully how things unfolded in coming months. She said the RBA's economists would be watching \"key transmission channels\" through which the United States' proposed trade tariffs would impact Australia's economy, in their different ways. She said those channels included: And she emphasised how difficult it had become to produce forecasts of economic activity in such a febrile environment. \"How will the current unpredictable and uncertain global environment transmit through to the Australian economy?\" she asked. \"The short answer is, we can't be completely sure. In last week's market chaos, traders turned their backs on US government bonds. Is Donald Trump destroying America's \"exorbitant privilege\"? \"The broad-based nature of the proposed US tariffs, retaliation from major partners and other policy shifts all have the potential to structurally alter the world economy. \"[Our] baseline forecast is for recent global developments to contribute to slower economic growth in Australia and a slightly weaker labour market. \"We also anticipate that, overall, the price of tradable goods will be slightly dampened. \"Together, these two outcomes mean that inflation is forecast to be a little lower than at the February Statement on Monetary Policy, settling around the midpoint of the 2-3 per cent target range. \"This forecast is based on several judgments and assumptions about the potency of the transmission channels I have discussed today,\" she said.",

Financial crime and money-laundering regulator AUSTRAC has announced new controls on crypto ATM operators, including $5,000 transaction limits. The rapid growth of crypto ATMs has outpaced regulation, with the machines increasingly used for illicit purposes, AUSTRAC says.",
        "raw_text": "Australians are losing millions of dollars each year to scams linked to cryptocurrency ATMs and older people have been the group most caught up in illicit activity through the machines. Financial crimes agency AUSTRAC has now intervened \u2014 introducing sweeping industry-wide controls after uncovering links to scams, money laundering and other illegal activity. The regulator has also refused to renew one crypto ATM (CATM) operator's registration. Cryptocurrency ATMs are located across the country \u2014 in petrol stations, convenience stores, supermarkets and takeaway shops. They allow users to convert cash into digital currencies like Bitcoin, which is transferred to a digital wallet. Some machines also let users cash out their cryptocurrency. With banks under growing pressure to crack down on scams and money laundering, authorities warn crypto ATMs are being exploited by criminals. Following a three-month analysis of data from nine crypto ATM operators, AUSTRAC has confirmed the machines are being used for scam and fraud-related transactions. The ABC understands the regulator was able to trace some transactions to scam hotspots in Asia and Europe, as well as groups linked to organised crime. Crypto ATM operators will now face a $5,000 limit on cash deposits and withdrawals, in an effort to limit the financial fallout of scams. AUSTRAC will also enforce enhanced customer due diligence requirements, mandatory scam warnings and more robust transaction monitoring obligations on the operators. The new controls come as fresh data from the Australian Federal Police (AFP) reveals Australians are losing millions of dollars each year to scams involving crypto ATMs. \"These conditions are designed to help protect individuals from scams by deterring criminals from directing them to a crypto ATM, as well as to protect businesses from criminal exploitation,\" AUSTRAC chief executive Brendan Thomas told ABC News. Brendan Thomas is the CEO of financial crimes agency AUSTRAC.(ABC News: Daniel Irvine) \"In light of the risks and harms, we consider it absolutely necessary to ensure the sector meets minimum standards and reduces the criminal misuse of crypto ATMs. \"We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these conditions and adjust them if needed.\" As part of the compliance crackdown, AUSTRAC has refused to renew the registration of Harro's Empires, a small South Australian crypto ATM operator. The company was ordered to shut down its four machines after the agency found ongoing risks that criminals could exploit them. \"This action draws a clear line in the sand and serves as a warning to other digital currency exchange providers that aren't meeting their responsibilities under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act,\" Mr Thomas said. Australians lost $3 million to scams involving crypto ATMs in the 12 months to January, according to reports made to the Australian Cyber Security Centre. Of the 150 reported incidents, the most common scams were investment scams (63), extortion emails (35), and romance scams (24). Most victims were women over 51. However, total losses are likely to be far higher, as many victims do not report these crimes. \"Australia is certainly a key target, given we have high levels of savings and wealth,\" AFP assistant commissioner for cyber command Richard Chin told ABC News. Richard Chin says at least $3 million was lost in scams involving cash deposits at cryptocurrency ATMs in the year to January.(ABC News: Daniel Irvine) Mr Chin said that once cash is converted into cryptocurrency and sent to a digital wallet, it's nearly impossible to retrieve. The scammer instructed the man to make several bank withdrawals and deposit the money into crypto ATMs. His funds could not be recovered. \"That money goes into an elaborate web of global money laundering and ultimately ends up back with the criminal organisations orchestrating these scams and running them at an industrial scale around the world.\" Australia has the third-highest number of crypto ATMs in the world, behind the United States and Canada \u2014 making it the fastest-growing market globally. In 2019, there were just 23 machines nationwide. Today, there are more than 1,800. \"The speed of the growth has concerned us,\" Mr Thomas told ABC News. \"We're worried that growth may be based on illicit activity and people being scammed. \"We're not only worried about people being victims of scams, we're also concerned about drug purchases and other money-laundering activities occurring through cryptocurrency ATMs.\" There are more than 1,800 crypto ATMs in Australia.(Source: Coin ATM Radar.) AUSTRAC estimates around $275 million flows through these machines each year across roughly 150,000 transactions. The vast majority \u2014 around 99 per cent \u2014 are cash deposits used to purchase cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoin, Tether and Ethereum. Based on its analysis, AUSTRAC believes one in 10 transactions may be linked to illegitimate activity, including drug trafficking, scams, and organised crime. \"Cryptocurrency as an industry represents a significant global money-laundering risk. \"We see eye-watering sums of money moving across borders for drug purchases, and the proceeds are being scammed,\" Mr Thomas said. Leigh Stark says if someone is asking you to buy them Bitcoin, it is most likely a scam.(ABC News: David Sciasci) The age profile of crypto ATM users has shocked regulators and closely aligns with the demographic most commonly targeted by international scams. People over 50 account for nearly 72 per cent of crypto ATM transactions by value. Those aged between 60 and 70 make up 29 per cent of all transaction value. These findings are echoed by at least one Melbourne petrol station worker, who spoke to the ABC on condition of anonymity. He said he typically sees two or three older people each week depositing cash into the on-site cryptocurrency ATM. Most, he said, are on the phone receiving step-by-step instructions from someone on how to use the machine. Robert was asked to deposit money into a crypto ATM after being targeted by online scammers.(ABC News: John Gunn) Most scam victims are first contacted online. Last year, Robert (whose name we've changed to protect his privacy) unwittingly became a money mule after applying for a work-from-home job he found online. \"They sent me a contract to sign \u2014 passport, driver's licence, bank account details, the lot,\" he said. At first, he was asked to perform simple online tasks like writing product reviews. But later, he received instructions to withdraw money deposited by his 'employer' and put it into a crypto ATM. \"She told me to take a photo of the ATM when I got there,\" Robert recalled. \"Then she sent back photos with instructions on what buttons to press. I'd never used one of those machines before \u2014 it took me about half an hour to figure it out.\" He was told to open a second account at another bank and over several weeks, he deposited thousands of dollars into a digital wallet through his local crypto ATM. Eventually, his banks flagged the activity. \"They said I might have been involved in something fraudulent. I was worried. I'm not that kind of person.\" Robert reported the incident to the ACCC's Scamwatch, which advised him to cancel all forms of ID and cease contact with the scammers. Crypto ATMs have made international headlines for the wrong reasons. They've been effectively banned in countries like the United Kingdom and Singapore, and are heavily restricted in others. Cryptocurrency devotees are riding the recent crypto wave fuelled by Donald Trump's re-election in the US. But Australian industry figures says businesses and consumers are being let down by a lack of regulation. In the US, lawmakers are considering new legislation to regulate the industry. Several lawsuits have already been filed, including one by the state of Iowa, which is suing operators Bitcoin Depot and CoinFlip for $US20 million ($31 million) over scam losses. In Australia, AUSTRAC last year established a dedicated taskforce to investigate the sector and introduced new compliance requirements aimed at stopping misuse. But Mr Thomas acknowledges that regulation hasn't kept pace with the industry's rapid growth. He has called for broader regulation of the cryptocurrency sector to support legitimate operators and protect consumers. \"Our taskforce is working to understand the money-laundering risks of cryptocurrency in Australia and is collaborating closely with industry to determine the controls we need,\" he said. A Localcoin-branded Bitcoin ATM in Canberra.(ABC News: David Sciasci) Global players such as CoinFlip, Localcoin, ByteFederal and Bitcoin Depot are competing for market share against local players in Australia's booming crypto ATM market. Operators charge users commissions of up to 20 per cent per transaction, in addition to other fees. The industry's peak body, the Digital Economy Council of Australia (DECA), acknowledges some ATMs are being exploited for scams and money laundering. However, DECA chair Paul Derham argued most customers are legitimate traders simply trying to access digital assets in the face of banking restrictions. \"One of the challenges Australians face is that if they want to buy crypto, sometimes their banks won't let them. \"So they withdraw cash and go to a crypto ATM instead,\" said Mr Derham, who is also a lawyer representing several global ATM operators. Mr Derham said while there are different views, broadly speaking the industry does not support transaction limits of $5,000. He said there would be additional compliance costs for businesses. Mr Derham said customers may also use multiple CATMs to get around the new conditions. \"The industry would prefer to control these thresholds themselves using their own risk-based approach \u2014 which they are legally required to do anyway. \"For example, if a person is considered low risk and has a long history with a CATM provider, they should have a higher threshold.\" Asked whether the business would remain viable if they could no longer be used for scams and money laundering, Mr Derham said: \"No-one's been able to crack the code to stop scams. Even Australia's biggest banks haven't been able to completely eliminate the risk. \"The reality is that some scams are being run by highly coordinated international networks \u2014 including state-backed actors \u2014 who are actively targeting vulnerable people.\"",

And presumably the regulators would have something to say. But it's not an entirely hypothetical scenario \u2014 one of Australia's major superannuation funds has just restored services, after being offline since mid-April. A leading tax expert has warned that if the federal government cannot pass its super tax changes, it will destroy any chances of bigger tax reform. More than 1 million HESTA members have endured a seven-week long \"limited services period\" thatleft them locked out of their accounts until the start of June. The HESTA website bore messages alerting customers, noting that members should contact the fund if urgent payments were required. The reason for the outage was for the fund to switch administration providers, which it said would bring \"the opportunity to develop more personalised experiences for members, making it easier for them to manage their super\". Consumer advocacy group Super Consumers Australia slammed the length and extent of the outage, arguing it reflected \"a real underinvestment in services\" and \"a lack of strategic vision\". With the decision made and the switch underway, all HESTA could do was try to minimise the pain. On Monday afternoon, after normal service was scheduled to have resumed, the fund's website indicated it was receiving a high volume of calls and apologised for inconveniencing customers. HESTA's website apologised for high call volumes after the scheduled resumption of services.(ABC News: Stephanie Chalmers) When bank customers are mistreated or disrupted, whether it be through poor conduct or technical failure, the banking sector is reminded \u2014 by everyone from the media and politicians to consumer groups and outraged customers on social media \u2014 of its social licence to operate. That is the unspoken understanding between the financial institutions and the public; that banks shouldn't just be money-making machines, that there is also an obligation to do right by their stakeholders. Most importantly, their customers. A consumer advocacy group has called for transparency around why the seven-week HESTA super fund outage was approved. It's a licence that extends to super funds \u2014 and it's implicit in the structure of industry funds that are owned and operated by members, for members. That's on top of the legal requirement for all super fund trustees to act in members' best financial interests. Australian workers don't opt in to super so their interaction with the sector isn't by choice. Self-managed super funds (SMSF) can be complex to set up and operate, and require tailored financial and legal advice, so it's unsurprising that they skew older and towards higher-income earners (85 per cent of SMSF members are over 45). That leaves most Australians (among them, the young, and lower and average income earners) in retail or industry super funds \u2014 choosing from a limited range of providers to handle a substantial chunk of their income, in many cases for decades. Australians don't frequently change super funds \u2014a 2018 Productivity Commission report foundthat, historically, fewer than 10 per cent of members switch funds each year. Like bank accounts, the barriers to switching funds can seem like an administrative nightmare, and the resulting loyalty rewards funds, rather than members. ABC News first reported on the HESTA outage after receiving messages from several concerned members, unable to access their funds. Some had been unaware of the outage until it had already begun. Others had received notification several months prior but then had issues withdrawing cash in advance, despite contacting the fund as HESTA had advised. Some HESTA members who contacted ABC News had difficulty accessing money to pay bills and settle property purchases.(AAP: Joel Carrett) Our reporter Adelaide Miller has continued to receive dozens of messages from members over the last seven weeks, some facing financial stress, including several who were at risk of a property purchase falling over. Each time questions were put to HESTA, customers ended up having their situation resolved \u2014 HESTA processed their withdrawals and personal disaster was avoided. The super fund even asked Miller if she could pass on the details of any member that had written into the ABC with concerns \u2014 apart from obvious privacy issues, the public broadcaster isn't resourced to, and shouldn't, act as a quasi-customer service team. If HESTA members were finding it easier to get in touch with the ABC than with HESTA, that surely raises a bright red flag. To hark back to the bank example, if your bill was looming and you couldn't withdraw your cash online, the likely first port of call would be to phone your bank. Contacting a news organisation is hardly an efficient or logical way to contact your financial institution \u2014 and it's extremely unlikely to have been your first instinct. By the time people contact journalists in these types of situations, they've typically exhausted their options, or believe any other avenue will prove futile. Admittedly, some of the HESTA members had not contacted the super fund first. In response, HESTA drew our attention to the communications on their website, referring to urgent transactions still being available. Some of the members who contacted the ABC didn't know whether their requests would fall into the urgent category,so had instead resorted to contingency plans, like borrowing money from friends or family. Others had tried to contact the fund with no success. Dozens of HESTA super fund members told ABC News they weren't aware of the planned outage, despite HESTA announcing the seven-week freeze back in February. Whether the members made the right or wrong calls, one thing is clear \u2014 and it isn't HESTA's communications. It's that on top of the inevitable disruption caused by the outage itself, the fund's messaging and customer service failed to both 1) inform all members, and 2) accurately convey what transactions were considered urgent. It's easy for HESTA to, in hindsight, process transactions that had been brought to the media's attention and state that the member would've been assisted all along. Of course, the outcome for the members who did have their withdrawals processed is the best-case scenario \u2014 but we'll never know how many stressful situations or financial difficulties were created and not redressed. HESTA also has more than 1 million members. People who are still working and accumulating their super are unlikely to be regularly logging in and checking their accounts. For most people, the outage would've passed without event, or even unnoticed. But the times when people need their money often come with high stakes \u2014 a death payout awaited after the loss of a loved one, a large withdrawal needed to complete a major transaction. At the centre of the multiple and varied problems facing super members in recent times lies a central issue \u2014 customer service. On first glance,a \"credential stuffing\" cyber attack, systemic issues withdeath payouts and insurance claims handling, and a multi-week planned outage don't have a lot in common. But all result in a sub-par experience for members \u2014 and all reflect the investment decisions made by the funds. Australia's corporate watchdog calls on superannuation funds to overhaul the way they deal with death benefit claims. Whether it bemulti-factor authentication to better protect customer accounts, beefed-up claims handling training and resourcing, or earlier investment in administration platforms, the solutions all involve putting a focus on how members experience their interactions with their super funds. In particular, the corporate regulator has death benefit claims handling in its sights,having taken court action against AustralianSuperandslamming the industry for poor customer serviceat a time in people's lives when they are extremely vulnerable. Australia's superannuation pool is worth nearly $4.2 trillion \u2014 the funds are undoubtedly extremely adept at taking and investing members' money. But when it comes helping members to access it, they are falling short. Earlier this year, the Grattan Institute highlighted thatmany retirees continue to grow their super balances decades after they retire, for fear of outliving their savings. The think tank said Australians are mostly steered towards account-based pensions, and half of those using those pensions draw down their super at the legislated minimum rates. Its modelling found those drawing down at the minimum rate when they retire will leave the equivalent of 65 per cent of their original super balance unspent by the age of 92. It's a sign that the default settings leave a lot of money unused and not enjoyed by retirees. After decades of accumulating income for their retirement, it seems many face barriers to withdrawing their funds \u2014 including knowing how much is needed to survive into old age, and overcoming the mental hurdle to confidently spend their super savings. The law puts the onus on super funds to act in the best financial interests of members. Those members should be able to access their funds easily when the time comes.",

        "raw_text": "The corporate regulator is suing insurance comparison provider Choosi for allegedly misleading customers through its insurance comparison services. In proceedings filed to the Federal Court, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) alleges Choosi has misled Australians by claiming to compare a range of funeral and life insurers. On its website, Choosi states: \"Compare the benefits and prices of a range of products from leading insurers so you can confidently choose cover that suits your needs, budget and lifestyle.\" ASIC alleges Choosi has misled Australians by stating it compares a range of funeral and life insurers.(ABC News: Adelaide Miller) However, ASIC claims that from the middle of July 2019, Choosi has only compared policies issued by a single insurer, except for on one occasion. \"Choosi is only comparing one insurer \u2014 Hannover Insurance \u2014 and so we're concerned that the representations to those consumers who looked at the website and heard that advertising have been misled,\" ASIC's deputy chair Sarah Court told The Business. Sarah Court alleges Choosi was being used as a platform to distribute Hannover products.(ABC News: Carl Saville) ASIC alleges that while the three funeral insurance products on Choosi's website have different branding, they are all issued by Hannover. Similarly, despite Choosi comparing five life insurance policies with different branding, they are once again all issued by Hannover \u2014 except for the period prior to July 2023, when Choosi included a single policy from an additional insurer. ASIC says all policies were distributed by Greenstone Financial Services \u2014 a company associated with Choosi. \"From a consumers perspective, they've come onto a website, they're told we will compare a range of products from a number of leading insurers,\" says Ms Court. Hannover is a global insurance provider with two entities in Australia \u2014 property and casualty insurance, and life and health insurance. ASIC is alleging Hannover paid Choosi about $61 million in commissions since 2019 to solely advertise products from its company on the comparison website. ASIC alleges Hannover paid Choosi about $61 million in commissions since 2019 to solely advertise products from its company on the comparison website.(ABC News: Adelaide Miller) \"What we're seeing here is the Choosi platform really being used by Hannover as just a platform to distribute its products, with no comparison going on with other insurers at all,\" says Ms Court. In a statement to the ABC, a spokesperson for Hannover has said: \"Hannover acknowledges the recent concerns raised by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) regarding certain products that appear on the Choosi website. \"As this is an ongoing legal matter before the court, we are unable to comment further at this time. We remain committed to providing our customers with insurance solutions that suit their needs.\" Ms Court says \"millions of people\" would have been exposed to Choosi's messaging over the six years since this arrangement began. \"We know that this was a very widespread advertising campaign by Choosi over many years... and we know there have been thousands of policies that have been sold,\" says Ms Court. ASIC alleges Choosi made the misleading representations on its website, across social media, and via television commercials and advertorials. Choosi says it finds policies from a range of trusted insurance brands.(Supplied) From July 1, 2019, until November 30, 2024, 4,225 funeral insurance policies and 9,478 life insurance policies have been sold. Ms Court has told the ABC if the Federal Court finds Choosi has misled customers, then \"it will be important for [ASIC] to seek substantial penalties\". \"[It's] to send a message to Choosi, but also as importantly, to send a message to the broader industry and others that run comparison websites\u2026 \"If you want to run these kind of sites then you certainly have to be very open and transparent with consumers about what it is that you're comparing.\" In a statement to the ABC, a spokesperson for Choosi said: \"Choosi is aware of the concerns raised by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) regarding certain aspects of our advertising. Choosi is currently reviewing the allegations and will take all the necessary steps and will respond accordingly. \"Our customers are at the heart of what we do. We are committed to making any necessary changes that best serves our customers.\" Ms Court says insurance comparison websites have an important role when they are operated and used correctly. \"We know that people are finding it difficult to afford insurance, difficult to access insurance, and so comparison websites could play a really important role in helping consumers with what is out there and helping them choose the products that are best for them.\" But she warns consumers to be \"wary\". \"[These comparison sites] are effectively commercial businesses, they make money in certain ways. \"So with Choosi, it was from getting commissions paid to it from the one insurer whose products it was selling,\" she says. While she urges consumers to do some \"due diligence\" by checking the policy's product disclosure statements, she says the onus is on the provider to do the right thing. \"Anyone that is a commercial provider offering a comparison website, you have to be up-front with what it is you are comparing, you need to be transparent with anyone, any consumer that's coming on to use your site.\"",

        "raw_text": "There is hope an Australia-first service using satellites to deliver text messages anywhere in the country will grow to become a game changer for Australians in mobile black spots. Telstra has launched a mobile-to-satellite service for some customers, delivered through SpaceX's Starlink service. While currently only available on select new phones, the technology is considered a significant breakthrough, providing coverage for people outside land-based 4G and 5G networks. Communications analyst Graham Lynch said while it was still early days, the technology had massive implications for rural Australians. Channa\u00a0Seneviratne is responsible for technical advancement at Telstra.(Supplied: Telstra) Initially, customers will only be able to text message using the service, and it will only work on a Samsung Galaxy S25 handset. Telstra's executive for technology engagement, Channa Seneviratne, said it was working to add additional handsets. \"In time, there will be more, including future support for Apple devices,\" Mr Seneviratne said. He said the service would be part of the standard contract, so there would be no extra charges, but he warned there could be some delays in sending and receiving messages. \"If the satellite is not quite overhead, it could take a few minutes,\" he said. Accompanying the rollout of the new service are questions about its reliability. Mr Lynch said testing of similar services in the United States produced patchy results. \"Messages get dropped, messages get missed,\" he said. Telstra is partnering with SpaceX to deliver text messaging via low Earth orbit satellites.(Supplied: Telstra) He said getting a reliable connection was challenging because low-Earth-orbit satellites (LEOsats) themselves are moving at about 25,000 kilometres per hour. \"The LEOsats are spinning very fast around a planet that is itself spinning very fast, so there's a lot of calibration involved in the physics,\" he said. The new messaging service uses LEOsats and direct-to-device (D2D) technology to transmit signals from space directly to mobile phones. Telstra is partnering with SpaceX to deliver text messaging services across Australia to areas without mobile coverage.(Supplied: Telstra) Users will connect automatically to the Starlink satellite if they are beyond the range of Telstra's mobile network on mainland Australia and Tasmania, excluding the Australian Radio Quiet Zone in Western Australia and remote offshore territories and islands. Many rural Australians are already using LEOsats to connect to services like Starlink, Sky Muster, Intelsat and Inmarsat for internet browsing, email, voice calls and texting. But the CEO of the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, Warren Pearce, said the technology had potentially life-saving implications for prospectors and others working remotely. People living and working remotely will be able to send a text message via their smart phone for the first time.(ABC News: Zara Margolis) Telstra said the service did not connect to emergency services yet and users would have to text a third party to call triple-0. TPG-Vodafone has already tested a service and Optus is working on it as well. Telstra is working on enabling voice calls using the LEOsat network, but it will not be available until 2027. Mr Pearce said that would be significant. \"If we can get to a point where we can make contact and have a conversation in every part of Australia, I think that would be a major breakthrough,\" he said. Warren Pearce says Telstra enabling voice calls using the LEOsat network will be significant.(ABC News: Phil Hemingway) Labor promised to include LEOsat services in thefederal government's universal mobile service obligation (UMSO) by 2027if it was elected at the most recent poll. This would require telcos to offer satellite services alongside mobile and fixed services. If that happens, Australia will be the first country in the world to take that step. Mr Lynch said other countries like the US and New Zealand were offering the service, but reliability was still an issue. \"They're not at the level where they can provide guarantees, which is what makes what Australia is planning to do so novel,\" he said.",

        "raw_text": "Waitlists for social housing grew in the four years to 2022, with the number of people being helped into homes falling, prompting a call for a reboot of the overburdened sector. The combination, outlined in a report from the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, is worsening wait times for people facing acute housing stress, according to its authors. \u201cIt\u2019s a painful and frustrating and horrible experience to go through, being on the waiting list,\u201d lead author Chris Martin, of the University of New South Wales, said. Researcher Chris Martin says the data points to a long queue for housing.(Supplied: University of New South Wales) As well as interviewing existing tenants and people waiting for housing, the researchers reviewed national data compiled for a 2024 study in the same research series. Based on state-by-state data, it showed more than 34,000 households across the country joined a waitlist in the roughly four years to 2022. But lettings \u2014 or new social housing allocations \u2014 suffered a 6,400 drop over the same period. Dr Martin said the data pointed to a long queue for supply so scarce itcould disincentivise people from moving out of the system. \u201cWhat we currently have is a process of people applying for this scarce form of assistance \u2014 a social housing tenancy \u2014 and then other forms of band-assistance that are offered, like help with rental bonds in the private market,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be a good time to start thinking in a formal and structured way, a strategic way, about reviewing the way access to housing assistance is done.\u201d Julie says she has been waiting for social housing for over a year.(ABC News: Jesse Thompson) One of the many people to have turned to social housing is Julie, who asked to use a pseudonym for professional reasons. Julie lives with complex health needs and was spending about two-thirds of a disability support pension on an unsuitable private market rental when she made a bid for priority social housing access in March last year. \u201cThere was a leak. It was damp, there were signs of mould. There were some steps in the building,\u201d she said of the private market home. She\u2019s still waiting for social housing to become available. Initially, she said, her government housing provider lost part of her application and asked her to resubmit it so she could be added to the priority list. When that happened, she said the application was incorrectly backdated, likely resulting in a longer wait. In the meantime, she\u2019s had to find a new private rental after learning her landlord would sell. \u201cThe system\u2019s literally designed to make you give up,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019ve just been so many hoops that I\u2019ve been made to jump through.\u201d Julie believes the system is designed to make would-be tenants like herself give up.(ABC News: Jesse Thompson) Sarah Toohey, of Community Housing Industry Association Victoria, said an underinvestment in social housing meant available homes were generally prioritised for people with complex needs. She said this cohort often stayed in social housing for longer, resulting in less turnover and a slowdown in homes becoming available. \u201cAt the moment, people put their name down, they don\u2019t hear very much and they wait upwards of 18 months to get a roof over their heads,\u201d she said. \u201cIn that time, we know that things that have led to their housing crisis can get worse.\u201d The study authors said the effects of decades of underinvestment in the social housing sector were gradually being reversedas state and federal governments looked to ease the housing crisis. Dr Martin said the renewed focus on the sector posed an opportunity to deliver housing support differently. \u201cIt may not always be about the golden ticket of a social housing tenancy, even though that\u2019s what a lot of people will rightly want and need,\u201d he said. His examples included additional assistance to very low-income households in the private market and a bigger focus on individual housing needs. Queensland recently reported an average wait time of about 21 months for high-needs households moving into government-owned social housing. In Victoria, priority households face a wait of about 18 months. The wait for a two-bedroom property in inner-city Sydney is 10 years or more.\u201cWe do need a more person-centred approach,\u201d Ms Toohey said. \u201cWe can integrate choice-based letting where people can search for their own social housing properties, or have a system whereby we check in on people on the list and see if there\u2019s any other housing assistance you can provide.\u201d Housing groups routinely call for governments to bring more social housing stock online.One recent reportfound Victoria alone would need an additional 377,000 homes to meet demand over the next two-and-a-half decades. Nationwide, the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute has previously predicted more than 1.1 million social dwellings will be needed by 2037.",

Dairy companies have revealed their opening milk prices, a month before the start of the financial year, as required under themandatory milk pricing code. This year's milk prices are up slightly on last year, ranging from $8.60 to $9.20 per kilogram of milk solids. But they are lower than what farmers were hoping for. Dairy farmers are facing climate challenges and rising costs of production.(ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton) The dairy heartlands of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania are in the grips of drought, while many farms in New South Wales and Queensland are recovering from floods. \"This is not a normal year,\" Colac dairy farmer and Dairy Farmers Victoria president Mark Billing said. \"The climate challenges we are seeing right across Victoria, coupled with extraordinary cost increases on farms, mean that farmers are carrying unprecedented levels of financial and emotional strain.\" He said companies risked the rapid decline of Australia's milk production if they did not increase prices to help dairy farmers through the tough times. \"Milk processors have repeatedly said they value their suppliers,\" Mr Billing said. Mark Billing says farmers are carrying unprecedented levels of strain.(ABC Rural: Jane McNaughton) The majority of farmers are paid for the level of fat and protein in their milk, known as milk solids. Many were hoping to be paid at least $9.20 to $9.50 per kilogram of milk solids, which equated to about 70 cents per litre. Mr Billing said the prices under $9.20 on offer from the dairy companies were not enough for farmers to get by. United Dairyfarmers of Victoria president Bernie Free agreed. \"It's pretty disappointing, really,\" he said. He said some farmers would quit the industry if milk prices did not go up soon. \"I think it's a concern that farmers may move out of the industry at this price mark, especially in [drought-affected] western Victoria,\" he said. \"Gippsland is not far behind us, and there are pockets in north-east Victoria that are doing it pretty tough. Dairy farmers are disappointed by the price they will be paid for their milk.(ABC News: Warwick Long) Dairy Australia's latest outlook shows the national milk pool is on track to drop 1 per cent this financial year, compared to the previous one. It has also forecast a further drop in production of up to 2 per cent in 2025/26. If that happened, milk production would sit around 8.24 billion litres, almost 3 billion less than the industry's peak in the early 2000s. Dairy Australia analysis and insights manager, Eliza Redfern, said ongoing challenges with the weather were affecting production. \"We are also seeing a lower appetite for farm business growth, and we do expect some farm exits to continue within the new season,\" she said. Dairy Australia is forecasting a drop in national milk production next financial year.(ABC News: Maren Preuss) Fonterra Oceania was the first milk company to announce its opening milk price for the next season, with one of the lowest prices \u2014 an average of $8.60 per kilo of milk solids. Its director of farm source and sustainability, Matt Watt, said while it was higher than last year's opening price, he understood farmers would like more. \"What we've got to do is make sure we're running a business that is here not only this year but for years to come,\" he said. \"That's our job, frankly, to make sure that we're continuing to make decisions that support paying a milk price that we're earning in the market. \"Sometimes that is a milk price that farmers appreciate and enjoy, and other times it takes a bit of time.\"",

        "raw_text": "Australia\u2019s rapid recovery under Tony Popovic in qualification for the 2026 World Cup has left the Socceroos on the cusp of a place in North America with two group games to play, and a direct berth could be secured as early as Friday morning. But the result of the Socceroos\u2019 match on Thursday in Perth against Japan \u2013 group leaders and already qualified \u2013 cannot alone guarantee the qualification fate of Australia, currently lying behind the Samurai Blue in second place. Instead, the group\u2019s other automatic qualification slot will be determined by the performances of third-placed Saudi Arabia in their two remaining matches \u2013 first away to Bahrain then on Tuesday in Jeddah against the Socceroos \u2013 and fourth-placed Indonesia who need two victories and a miracle. Saudi Arabia are Australia\u2019s main rivals, trailing by just three points, but with a goal difference of -2 compared to the Socceroos\u2019 +7. It means if Australia avoid defeat against the Green Falcons next week, they are almost guaranteed second place. And if they do something they haven\u2019t done in 16 years on Thursday \u2013 beat the Samurai Blue, who have sent a squad missing several key players \u2013 it will be time for Socceroos fans to start checking flights to Mexico, the US and Canada. The players are aware of the odd qualification situation, and the strange dynamic whereby \u2013 even if they win on Thursday \u2013 they won\u2019t be able to fully celebrate after the game. \u201cIf we do get the win, hopefully, which we will, we are obviously almost there,\u201d defender Milos Degenek said on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see how Bahrain play with Saudi, obviously.\u201d That game in Riffa kicks off at 2am AEST. The permutations are largely positive for the Socceroos, but just last year they looked precarious. A shock home loss to Bahrain and draw with Indonesia triggered the departure of former coach Graham Arnold, who had taken the Socceroos to the round of 16 in Qatar and a gallant defeat to eventual winners Argentina. Popovic won his first match against China, is yet to taste defeat, and appears to have earned the trust of the players. \u201cThe way we see the national team is completely different to what it was before,\u201d Degenek said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much pride and there\u2019s so much, I guess, love for the shirt and the culture that the boss has brought in here.\u201d The team has benefited from the new qualifying format for the 48-team tournament to be held in the US, Canada and Mexico, an increase of 16 teams compared to Qatar and an extra three slots for the Asian Football Confederation. Even if the Socceroos let slip their automatic qualification opportunity in coming days, there is a fourth round and, failing that, a playoff phase. \u201cNow that there\u2019s more countries at the World Cup, there\u2019s a \u2013 if you don\u2019t qualify through this group stage \u2013 another group stage, and you get through that group stage is another playoff game. So there\u2019s another almost a year of football if you don\u2019t qualify directly,\u201d Degenek said. \u201cSo hopefully we\u2019ll do the job to on Thursday, and hopefully Bahrain can do a job for us as well.\u201d Sign up toFootball Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion Failure to qualify for the 48-team tournament would be damning for this generation of players, coaches and administrators. But the Socceroos, ranked 26 by Fifa, are trying not to look beyond Thursday\u2019s showdown. They have not beaten Japan since 2009, and have done so only twice this century. The first was the famous 3-1 comeback inspired by Tim Cahill in the 2006 World Cup. Three years later he scored twice again in a 2-1 victory at the MCG. Since then it has been 10 matches without an Australian victory, including a defeat in the 2011 Asian Cup final and five losses in six matches between 2013 and 2022. That run was ended by the stoic display in Saitama in October, when the Socceroos came away with a 1-1 draw. That result, and a draw with Saudi Arabia three months ago, are the only matches in which the Samurai Blue have dropped points this phase, which has consolidated their place as Asia\u2019s leading power. The side ranked 15 in the world could afford to leave out European stars including Brighton\u2019s Kaoru Mitoma, Ao Tanaka of Leeds, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s Ko Itakura, Feyenoord\u2019s Ayase Ueda and Sporting\u2019s Hidemasa Morita from the squad for Thursday\u2019s match, which includes seven first-time call-ups. Degenek challenged the notion that this would make Japan any less formidable, warning the new and fringe players will be motivated to earn their place in the squad for the World Cup. \u201cIt\u2019s even harder for us that those so-called stars are out, because the boys that are coming in, whether they\u2019re from the J-League or other clubs in Europe, are going to want to prove to the boss that they should be there at the World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not going to be a walk in the park.\u201d",

        "raw_text": "Socceroos star Craig Goodwin will miss Australia\u2019s crunch World Cup qualifiers against Japan and Saudi Arabia after being cut down by a foot injury that requires surgery. Coach Tony Popovic named his extended 26-man squad on Sunday ahead of Thursday night\u2019s blockbuster against Japan in Perth, and there were plenty of big names missing. Free agent Kusini Yengi was deemed not match fit enough after struggling for game time with Portsmouth, while Nestory Irankunda is nursing a hamstring injury that has also ruled him out of action for the Australia Under 20s. Johnny Warren Medallist Nicolas Milanovic and Max Balard were overlooked in tough selection calls, while the international future of Nectarios Triantis remains shrouded in mystery after he declined an offer to join the Socceroos\u2019 recent training camp in Abu Dhabi. Injuries have scuppered the hopes of Mathew Leckieand Nishan Velupillay whileJackson Irvine was already ruled out. But in an unexpected blow for the Socceroos, Goodwin will be sidelined for a yet-to-be-determined period after succumbing to a foot injury. The news comes just days after Goodwin, who has been plying his trade with Saudi Arabian side Al-Wehda, announced he would be rejoining Adelaide United on a three-year deal. \u201cHe has a foot problem and will be requiring surgery,\u201d Popovic told reporters in Perth. \u201cIt\u2019s something he\u2019s tried to avoid. I think the last month or so he\u2019s been trying to get through the games. \u201cIt\u2019s something I think he\u2019s had ongoing for a while but being able to manage it, and it\u2019s just got to a point that he needs to intervene.\u201d Triantis, who is signed by Sunderland but spent the season on loan at Scottish outfit Hibernian, was initially meant to be part of the Socceroos\u2019 training camp. The 22-year-old pulled out at the last minute, and there\u2019s no guarantees he will commit his future to the Socceroos, given he is also eligible to play for Greece. \u201cI\u2019m not too sure where it exactly sits,\u201d Popovic said. \u201cWe had him in the squad for the camp, and on the day that he was supposed to travel he informed us that he\u2019s not coming in. \u201cHe just said he\u2019s got a lot of things on at the moment, a lot on his mind in terms of what he wants to do. We have to respect that, and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Australia sit third in the qualifying groupon 13 points and will round out their campaign against Japan in Perth on Thursday and third-placed Saudi Arabia (10 points) in Jeddah the following Tuesday. The top two in the group will automatically qualify for the 2026 World Cup, and Australia can guarantee their place if they beat Japan at Optus Stadium on 5 June.

        "raw_text": "One of the key themes of the past week for theMatildashas been a sense of serendipity. On Friday, Tom Sermanni\u2019s 150th fixture in charge of the national team was marked by Kahli Johnson\u2019s goal ina 2-0 win over Argentina, as the debutante became the latest in the long line of players whose international journey has started with the veteran coach. On Monday, the final game of Sermanni\u2019s tenure was played hours afterJoe Montemurro was formally unveiledas the team\u2019s next full-time coach. Montemurro watched on from the stands of GIO Stadium as he begun preparations for the first games of his reign later this month. After coaching the Matildas across four separate decades, his final hitout in charge came in the same city where his coaching career began back in the 1980s. As one era ended, a player hoping to play a key role in the next demanded the attention of the incoming boss during the second game against Argentina. In her first start for 549 days, Amy Sayer grabbed a first-half brace to help steer the Matildas towardsa 4-1 win in Canberra, before Emily van Egmond and hometown hero Michelle Heyman put the result beyond doubt. With Sermanni\u2019s third stint in charge of the Matildas now over, focus now turns to what comes next. As the 70-year-old himself reflected, his three stints in charge have intersected with the major eras of this team, and while he is too self-effacing to acknowledge it, that means stories of the Matildas cannot be told without him. He was there when the modern Matildas program was being established in 1993, and when Australian football made its move to Asia, before laying down a marker of what was to come with a continental crown in 2010. During his latest stint in charge, he was offered a chance to experience a team he had been so instrumental in building, after it had ascended to being something more. The 25,125 fans in Canberra \u2013 a record for a women\u2019s sporting event in the Australian capital \u2013 was testament to this. \u201cBack in the days when you\u2019d essentially get family and friends to come to games, you dreamt of stuff like this\u201d Sermanni told Paramount. \u201cIt\u2019s just a dream come true.\u201d It\u2019s this history that made his appointment as an interim such a key one. Not just because he deserved an opportunity to bask in the glow that exists around the side, but also because his willingness to do whatever is in the team\u2019s best interests \u2013 demonstrated across multiple decades \u2013 is indisputable. When he walked back in the door last October, he described the atmosphere that greeted him as being akin to \u201cturning up at a funeral\u201d following a disastrous Paris Olympics. Combining an existing relationship with much of the squad and an unimpeachable record of service with a humble lack of ambition to make this anything permanent, he filled the temporary role perfectly. Yet, the results against the biggest nations weren\u2019t there. And the effects of an extended period of limbo as Football Australia\u2019s search for a permanent coach continuedwere clear to everyone during three games in February. While he did his best to bring through new talent and prepare the side for what was to come, as a caretaker there was a limit to his authority. Outside of the retired Clare Polkinghorne, much of the established squad looks set to still be in place come next year\u2019s Asian Cup, and it wasn\u2019t Sermanni\u2019s place to say otherwise. That is Montemurro\u2019s responsibility. Sign up toMoving the Goalposts No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women\u2019s football after newsletter promotion But Sermanni cannot be blamed for the maladroit hunt for a full-time replacement. Back-to-back losses to Brazil and a winless SheBelieves Cup weren\u2019t part of the plan, but neither was him being in an interim role for nearly a year. He came in and did his job in getting the team back on its feet, and then the federation turned around and asked him to keep doing it. He would have been well within his rights to put decision-makers on blast, but doing what was best for the Matildas came first. Starting with Daniela Galic and ending with Isabel Gomez, nine players have made their international debuts during his brief tenure, while others such as Sayer, Holly McNamara, and Clare Wheeler have grown in prominence. Fittingly, Sermanni used one of his final appearances as coach of the Matildas to call for improvements to resourcing and staffing in the A-League Women, attempting to spur even more progress for the game, even after his exit. If some of the recent results have damaged Sermanni\u2019s standing in the eyes of a new generation of fans who have rallied around the Matildas, they shouldn\u2019t. He has played an irreplaceable role since before many of them were born. And now, with the Montemurro era looming, he can kick back.",

        "raw_text": "The first time Tom Sermanni coached theMatildasin Canberra, three decades ago, the match took place not at GIO Stadium but at an unassuming training field next door. A warm-up encounter ahead of the 1995 Women\u2019s World Cup, the Matildas put four unanswered goals past New Zealand in front of a handful of spectators. It warranted three paragraphs deep in the sports section of the local newspaper; the report described the win as a \u201cgreat result\u201d for Sermanni. Thirty years later, in his 151st and final game as Matildas boss, at the end of his third stint at the helm of the national team, it was another great result: a 4-1 friendly victory over Argentina on a chilly Monday night. A brace by Amy Sayer and second-half strikes from Emily Van Egmond and local hero Michelle Heyman were enough to see off a valiant Argentine effort. But it was also an encounter that underscored the remarkable rise of the women\u2019s game since Sermanni first led the Matildas in the nation\u2019s capital. A capacity crowd of 25,125 broke the record for the best attended women\u2019s sporting event in Canberra. Local newspaper Canberra Times heralded the game on its front page: \u201cTillies Time!\u201d. News of the appointment ofSermanni\u2019s successor, Joe Montemurro, had dominated national media all day. The 70-year-old Sermanni has been a loyal servant for the Matildas, playing an important role in the team\u2019s progression across more than a decade in charge \u2013 including leading the Matildas to their most significant silverware yet, the 2010 Women\u2019s Asian Cup. It was a fitting send-off as the Matildas now prepare for a critical lead-up to a home Asian Cup next year, and then a period of generational transition ahead. After seeing off La Albiceleste withtwo unanswered goals in Melbourne on Friday, the Matildas started strongly \u2013 notching their first attempt within minutes. The one-way traffic soon proved decisive, as midfield maestro Sayer connected with a ball from Kahli Johnson to coolly open the scoring after 14 minutes. Sayer\u2019s gloves hinted at the arctic Canberra temperatures, but her opener gave the crowd a reason to keep warm. Sermanni\u2019s send-off was not going to be a procession, though. Argentina hit back less than 10 minutes later; 19-year-old Kishi N\u00fa\u00f1ez \u2013 a stand-out for the South Americans at last year\u2019s U20 World Cup \u2013 making a decisive break down the left flank before blazing the ball past a diving Teagan Micah. The Argentinian goal left the Matildas unsettled; a feeling compounded when Johnson was forced off with an injury to be replaced by Melbourne City\u2019s rising star Holly McNamara. A more evenly-matched period of play followed, as the Matildas rallied to regain the momentum. Then, suddenly, Caitlin Foord pounced. The Arsenal star,fresh off winning the Women\u2019s Champions League, collected the ball in the middle of the park and went on a marauding run forward. Foord sliced through the heart of the Argentina defence before offloading to Sayer, who only had to beat custodian Solana Pereyra to double her tally. Caitlin Foord and Amy Sayer combine late in the first half to regain the CommBank Matildas' lead \ud83c\udfaf#Matildas#AUSvARGpic.twitter.com/aSppkeM0kC Both teams had chances early in the second half, the Matildas with the better of the opportunities but Argentina continuing to threaten. The biggest roar of the night was reserved for the addition of Canberra United great Heyman, brought on after 60 minutes for Sayer. The veteran striker was immediately in the thick of the action, and her darting run into the Argentina box created the Matildas\u2019 third goal \u2013 poked home by Van Egmond after Heyman and Pereyra had collided. Heyman then sealed the dominant victory with a goal in the dying minutes, attacking a loose ball before outwitting Pereyra. The win caps an improved run of friendlies for the Matildas \u2013 successive wins over Argentina and South Korea \u2013 after three consecutive losses at the SheBelieves Cup in February. Montemurro will begin his national team tenure with two friendlies against Slovenia at the end of June.

Indeed the match report from that first Canberra outing used the team\u2019s prior name, the Female Socceroos. How times have changed. After the match, Sermanni noted that the home crowds during his latest tenure with the Matildas have been consistently sold-out \u2013 testament to the Matildas\u2019 beloved status across the country. \u201cI pinch myself when I stand in front of it before the game starts \u2013 and think: \u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m still here\u2019 \u2013 I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve had the privilege to be back in this environment,\u201d Sermanni said. \u201cThe fact that we can come out on a cold Monday night and fill a stadium \u2013 it\u2019s just phenomenal.\u201d It was a sentiment echoed by his goal-scoring star. \u201cI never would have imagined [a crowd like this] \u2013 the game has grown so much,\u201d said Sayer, returning to the national team starting line-up after a lengthy injury absence. \u201cIt just goes to show how big the Matildas have become, how big women\u2019s football has become.\u201d",

        "raw_text": "The winning moment is perfect. Perfect in concept, in balance, in execution, in placement, in flourish. The ball disappears through mid-on, and before it has even reached the boundary the lid is off and the smile is unsheathed, and for some reason it matters a great deal that the stroke to complete a towering one-day chase of 309 is not a wallop or a swipe, but an artful on-drive for four. But then for all his brilliance, there has always been a pleasingly jarring quality to Root in limited\u2011overs cricket, even a kind of quiet defiance. His match\u2011winning 166 against the West Indies on Sunday was perhaps his greatest white-ball innings, but above all it was simply aJoe Rootinnings, all gentle nudges and classical drives, timing over power, manoeuvrability over muscularity, a triumph of pure talent. My favourite bit of a Root white-ball innings is when he hits a six. Which he actually does quite a lot \u2013 53 times in one-day internationals, more than Alex Hales, narrative fans \u2013 but for some reason never fails to tickle him. As if this wasn\u2019t really supposed to happen, as if he\u2019s just done something terribly naughty, and his big daft face breaks out into a big daft grin, the grin of an auntie who has just said \u201cshit\u201d at the Christmas dinner table. \u201cUltimately, you\u2019re playing a game of cricket,\u201d Root said a few months ago in an interview with ESPNCricinfo, during a largely unheralded stint with the Paarl Royals Twenty20 franchise. \u201cMost of the basic things within the game are exactly the same. You\u2019ve just got less time to figure it out.\u201d And for some reason Root has always felt the need to justify his presence in the white-ball game, has always been aware on some level of his outsider status. Which for a player who was the top scorer in a winning World Cup side, who was responsible for one of the all-time great Twenty20 knocks for England (against South Africa in 2016), who averages almost 50 in 50-over cricket and has now overtaken Eoin Morgan as his country\u2019s leading ODI run-scorer, feels faintly absurd. But the sense of impostor syndrome goes back years. In 2018, at the very height of his powers, he entered the Indian Premier League auction for the first time and went unsold. Later that summer he was dropped from the T20 side for the first time. Then came the long slow retreat: just 19 ODIs between the 2019 and 2023 World Cups, during which he averaged 28. In 2024 he did not play a single white-ball game for England. There is no real need for revisionism here. Between 2019 and 2023 Root was simply not playing enough good white-ball cricket to justify his place, his spells in the side too fitful to be of any use. All the same it speaks volumes of the man that, as he put it on Sunday night, he felt \u201cguilt\u201d at not being able to help Jos Buttler more. \u201cI almost felt guilty that I wasn\u2019t there for him throughout a lot of his tenure,\u201d he said. To briefly refresh our memories: this was a period during which Root was dealing with the Test captaincy, multiple Ashes series, Covid bubbles, Covid isolation, Covid fatigue, the fallout from a seismic racism scandal that engulfed not just his county but his entire sport, and an era of English cricket in which red ball was simply not the priority, an atrophying side in which he was basically the only guy capable of scoring runs.

Sign up toThe Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend\u2019s action after newsletter promotion Even so, what is undeniable is that during those years of white-ball recession the game bounded on without him. The supremacy of 360-degree power hitting, soaring scoring rates and extreme specialism threatened to leave him behind. Now aged 34, he probably has to make peace with the fact that unlike his Big Four counterparts \u2013 Steve Smith, Virat Kohli, Kane Williamson \u2013 he will make little to no imprint in the sport\u2019s most popular and culturally dominant format. Of what use, then, were the years of toil and sacrifice, slogging his guts out for a failing team in a failing format? What was it all for? Was he ultimately cricket\u2019s equivalent of Stevens the butler in The Remains of the Day, dutifully giving over his life in service of a doomed, ignoble ideal? Will it ever be possible again to achieve greatness in this sport without genetic advantages and brute strength? I want to believe it\u2019s possible. I want to believe that for all the cultural entropy, for all the schedule fragmentation, for all the greed and confusion, this is all still cricket, that pure talent can still conquer. I love that Jasprit Bumrah still wants to play all formats, that Harry Brook does, that Rashid Khan does. I love that Sikandar Raza flew straight from a Test match in Nottingham to a Pakistan Super League final in Lahore, that each game mattered so much that he had to do both. I love that Root is 34 but still wants to learn and grow, that one of the most ridiculously talented cricketers of my lifetime still has worlds he wants to conquer, parts he\u2019s still trying to figure out. Maybe the evening really is the best part of the day. There\u2019s a clarity, a sense of purpose. It\u2019s a bat, a ball, stumps and a field. The basic game is the same. He\u2019s just got less time to figure it out.",

        "raw_text": "England spent much of this game digging themselves into not so much a hole as a full-blown trench, a toxic combination of regular errors and occasional misfortune leaving them in a truly desperate situation, \u00adapparently destined for convincing and deserved defeat. EnterJoe Root, and an innings for the ages. Root produced a display of ethereal stroke-making on his way to a stunning, unbeaten 166, a batting performance of such beauty that the ugliness of much that came before will be forgotten. It was his highest score in one-day internationals, propelling him past Eoin Morgan to become England\u2019s leading run-scorer in this format, and the first Englishman to score more than 7,000. It ended with a straight drive that brought his 23rd boundary, victory by three wickets, and a series secured with a game to spare. Typically, the match-winner sought afterwards to deflect credit rather than to bask in it. \u201cThe way we managed to wrestle it back to [a target of] 309, I thought it was exceptional work from the bowlers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been a lot of England teams I\u2019ve played in before where we\u2019ve ended up with 350 and then it\u2019s a completely different chase.\u201d There was praise also for Harry Brook\u2019s captaincy: \u201cHe led the team really well, that\u2019s a really good sign for us moving forward. He might not always be the most intelligent away from cricket, but he understands the game exceptionally well,\u201d and for Will Jacks, who scored 49 in an unfamiliar role at No\u00a07, mostly in singles as he sought to give Root the strike: \u201cTo show that maturity, the skill, the calmness, and the clarity was really impressive.\u201d After Keacy Carty\u2019s century, Shai Hope\u2019s 66-ball 78 and a brilliant start to their efforts in the field West Indies will be asking themselves where, across a blustery day at Sophia \u00adGardens, they were blown off course. Their minds will snag on the final delivery of the sixth over of \u00adEngland\u2019s innings, when Matthew Forde wheeled away in celebration, with arms outstretched and nary a backward glance, after thudding the ball into Root\u2019s back pad. He had reached the slip cordon by the time he turned back to see an immobile umpire, and the inevitable review showed the ball would have clipped the bails but not with sufficient force for the on-field decision to be reversed. Root had scored seven. The next delivery, the first of a fresh over, kissed Brook\u2019s bat and was put down by Hope behind the stumps. \u201cWe know what the game could have been if things had gone our way,\u201d Carty said. If they had, \u00adEngland would at that point have been 41 for four. Even in victory England will know that, after a whipcrack-smart performance in the opener on \u00adThursday, this was a very different story. Their \u00adfielding display was peppered with misfields, fluffed run-outs and dropped catches, and for a while they carried that form into their \u00adbatting. Their target might have looked eminently achievable as Ben Duckett and Jamie Smith strode out but it had taken on a quite different appearance by the time both openers strode in again, neither of them having scored. Duckett\u2019s dismissal, flaying a wide delivery from Forde to Jayden Seales at wide third man, completed what was for him a particularly miserable outing, given that he was also responsible for two of those drops and the worst of the missed run-outs. Root and Brook added 85 for the third wicket before the England captain, having motored to 47 off 36, misjudged a hook off Joseph and set up another Seales catch.

        "raw_text": "As the dust settles on Manchester United\u2019s post-season tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong, the question must be asked: was it worth it? United may have pocketed around \u00a310m from their six-day, two-match visit to Asia but what they lost was arguably worse. And no, we\u2019re not just talking about their1-0 defeat against the \u201cAsean All Stars\u201din Kuala Lumpur, a scratch, invitational side that had never previously played together. Omar Berrada, United\u2019s chief executive,had excitedly hailed the tour as an \u201copportunity for us to collaborate with our valued commercial partners, and to deepen relationships with our fans\u201d. That vision probably didn\u2019t include Amad Diallo sticking his middle finger up at supporters, a gesture for which herefused to apologise, the winger insisting he did it in response to insults about his mother. Nor did it allow for Alejandro Garnacho sulking and yawning through his various off-pitch duties. It remains to be seen how many key performance indicators were met by the Argentinian, who finished the tour by posting a one-word caption on the runway as United departed home to Europe: \u201cfinally\u201d. At least Matthijs De Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee, Ayden Heaven and Patrick Dorgu put on a brave face, smiling and waving through the sparsely-attendedopen-top bus tour of Kuala Lumpur, as an accompanying PA system blared out \u201cGlory, Glory, Man United\u201d. Hours later, United lost their first match of the tour, against the All Stars. Ruben Amorim did little to spin the defeat into anything positive. \u201cThe boos from the fans, maybe it is something we need because every game that we lost in the Premier League they were always there,\u201d the Portuguese manager said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have it in us not to choke in every exercise, in every game \u2013 that is what happened. We should win these kind of games, no matter what.\u201d United went 1-0 behind against Hong Kong on Friday but rallied to win the second match of the tour 3-1. After a disastrous season in which United finished just above the relegation zone, this was meant to be a money-making charm offensive \u2013 the club promising \u201ca summer like no other\u201d \u2013 but the tour seems to have done more harm than good. It ended up as another opportunity for defeat and derision, enforcing the idea that United are a spent force, and widening the gap between the team and their supporters. There were thousands of unsold tickets, while fans hoping to watch the first game in Kuala Lumpur on the club\u2019s YouTube channel were treated to extensive buildup and the first 35 seconds of the match before being redirected to a pay-per-view MUTV broadcast. Amid all the selfies and handshakes and suggestions of \u201cglory\u201d, there is a sordid and calculated underbelly here. Yes, money was made, but is \u00a310m worth it to a team that isabout to spent \u00a362.5m on a new forward? The disastrous nature of United\u2019s jaunt to Asia brings into question the viability of post-season tours in general. In a world where elite clubs are all too vocal in complaining about fixture congestion and injuries, these tours add mental and physical fatigue to already exhausted bodies, not to mention needless air miles with adverse environmental impact. United\u2019s players left for Malaysia on 25 May, just hours after their final Premier League of the season, against Aston Villa. Having landed on Saturday, most of the senior squad will now report for international duty before World Cup qualifiers this weekend. United\u2019s senior players will not have any meaningful break until mid-June and are expected back for pre-season in early July, before the club\u2019s pre-season tour to Sweden and the US. United are not alone in these missteps. Tottenham and Newcastle embarked on post-season tours to Australia this time last year and played each other in Melbourne on 22 May 2024, three days after the final day of the 2023-24 season. Kieran Trippier, who captained Newcastle in that Melbourne fixture, admitted the trip was \u201cnot ideal\u201d before his commitments with England at Euro 2024, a tournament in which the right-back struggled for fitness. Sign up toFootball Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion Injuries and fatigue plagued Tottenham\u2019s start to the season, too. And if Spurs\u2019 post-season tour wasn\u2019t directly responsible for that it certainly didn\u2019t help, while Daniel Levy\u2019s comments at a Tottenham fans\u2019 forum in September that he \u201cwould like to see less games, but higher-quality games\u201d were subsequently difficult to stomach. It is difficult to determine exactly how big the environmental impact is for these tours. The pre-season before Sir Jim Ratcliffe bought a stake inManchester United, the club offset 450 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions to cover the necessary air travel by players and staff to the US. Perhaps unsurprisingly for a club that is now part-owned by a company with interests in everything from petrochemicals to mass plastic production, there has been no mention of offsetting emissions for the trip to Malaysia and Hong Kong, which included 14,000 air miles for the team alone. The Professional Footballers\u2019 Association\u2019s sustainability champion, David Wheeler,has spokenof the harm caused by such tours. \u201cIt\u2019s not only irresponsible from a climate point of view, but from a player care point of view, physically and mentally,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cThey are human beings. They get paid very well, as we know, but they have a limit to what their bodies can take and how they cope with it from a mental health point of view\u201d. The organisation\u2019s chief executive, Maheta Molango, has also \u201cexpressed concern about these post-season tours\u201d. Despite the arguments to the contrary, post-season tours look here to stay, part of a new footballing landscape almost nobody asked for. And there will be plenty of other clubs that plead poverty and set sail for distant lands in the future. For now, we have to find something else to watch before the start of the Club World Cup in a couple of weeks\u2019 time \u2013 a month-long tournament absurdly relaunched by Fifa, with a$1bn (\u00a3775m) prize pot. Manchester United must wish they had an invite.",

Kasatkina finally bowed out at Roland Garros on Monday, beaten by 18-year-old fellow Russian-born friend Mirra Andreeva 6-3, 7-5 after what the victorious teenager called a \u201chell of a match\u201d in the fourth round at Roland Garros. Two months since being granted permanent residency, Kasatkina\u2019s hopes of becoming the first Australian woman to reach the quarter-finals since Ash Barty\u2019s triumphant year of 2019 may have fallen short, but the 28-year-old, who enjoyed being the \u201clast Aussie standing\u201d, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a good start. \u201cFirst of all it\u2019s been a good result but also, I felt super good to step on the court as an Australian player,\u201d said the 17th seed. \u201cTo feel the support from the stands so many times.

Their 94-minute duel on Court Suzanne Lenglen ended with Kasatkina chucking her wristband jokingly at her conqueror at the net, while Andreeva informed the crowd tongue-in-cheek that she only practised with the Australian because she hated her. \u201cMaybe we know each other too good, maybe we have to take a break in practising ... no, I\u2019m kidding,\u201d said Kasatkina. The only other time they had played a match was in the final of last October\u2019s Ningbo Open in China, with Andreeva ending in tears and needing to be comforted by the player 10 years her senior after blowing a 3-0 lead in the final set. Things have clearly changed. Andreeva has grown up. This time, she said it was easy to put friendship aside as she repelled Kasatkina\u2019s second-set surge when the world No 17 went from 3-1 down to 5-3 up, with a combination of the most extraordinary defensive resolve and some ferocious attacking shots. All looked lost for Kasatkina at the start of the second, but she lived up to her promise that she was ready to \u201cdie on court\u201d as she chased down seemingly impossible causes and even outlasted the youngster to win one remarkable 26-shot rally. And that utter determination did give Andreeva problems as Kasatkina earned a set point on the youngster\u2019s delivery at 5-4, only to be deprived by a powerful forehand.

        "raw_text": "There was no justification for Max Verstappen\u2019s rash and futile act of retribution at the Spanish Grand Prix, when he deliberately drove into the side of George Russell\u2019s car. The world champion knows it and on Mondayhe admitted as muchwith something of a mea culpa on social media. Yet it also must be considered that it is part and parcel of what makes Verstappen so competitive, albeit in this case in an entirely unedifying and self\u2011defeating fashion. Angry and frustrated at a sequence of events in Barcelona, including having to cede a place to\u00a0Russell, Verstappen surrendered to his baser instincts. Having pulled over to give the place to Russell, he clearly then felt a point had to be made and accelerated back up the inside to collide with the Mercedes. He took a 10-second penalty, dropping him to 10th, putting him 49 points behind the championship leader Oscar Piastri, with three points added to his licence. One more penalty and he will receive a one-race ban. He conceded on Monday that he was \u201cfrustrated\u201d, his emotions were running high and that the move was \u201cnot right and shouldn\u2019t have happened\u201d. Clearly he had had time to cool down and gain some perspective from what was a moment of madness, but even given the chain of events \u2013 which were hardly rage-inducing stuff \u2013 this was still shocking from an F1 veteran at 27 years old and a four\u2011time world champion. It was the purposeless anger that really caught the eye, rather than the severity of the action itself. The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, described it as \u201cincomprehensible\u201d and his interpretation of it in the immediate aftermath bears repeating. \u201cThe great ones, whether it\u2019s in motor racing or in other sports, you just need to have\u00a0the world against you and perform at the highest possible level,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why sometimes these greats don\u2019t recognise that actually the world is not against you, it\u2019s just you who has made a mistake or you\u2019ve\u00a0screwed up.\u201d Verstappen has displayed this attitude in the past, while hisRed Bullteam have at times positively cultivated the \u201cus\u2011against\u2011the\u2011world\u201d stance, with their contention they have never been quite taken seriously because they are backed by an energy drink manufacturer. Verstappen has also been clear in the past that he believes the rules around overtaking are over\u2011prescriptive and this too doubtless fed into his frustration. He was similarly aggrieved in Mexico last season when he was penalised twice for two rash manoeuvres on the same lap against Lando Norris. \u201cWhat is allowed, what isn\u2019t, is not very natural,\u201d he said on Sunday, in reference to the regulations. Even given that antipathy, it is hard not to sense that the driver who can be as controlled and composed as they come, who will grind out a result from nowhere, who has been dragging his recalcitrant car by the scruff of the neck to the front of the grid this season, can sometimes simply succumb to a base, emotive response that is really beneath him but which he cannot seem to quite suppress. That is disappointing, because Wolff is also correct in identifying Verstappen as one of the greats. He may be flawed but he is without doubt an exceptional driver, a generational talent. His uncompromising attitude, drive and competitive spirit inform part of what makes him so good and so hard to beat \u2013 but on Sunday those attributes went unrestrained to his cost. The Dutchman shares those ultra\u2011competitive traits with others, perhaps notably Michael Schumacher and Ayrton Senna, but there is also a fundamental difference. When Schumacher ruthlessly and deliberately clashed with Damon Hill at Adelaide in 1994 and then Jacques Villeneuve at Jerez in 1997, he had a specific purpose in mind \u2013 the moves were with the intent of winning the world championship. Similarly, Senna taking out Alain Prost at Suzuka in 1990. Cynical, ruthless, ugly and unsportsmanlike, without doubt, but notably with purpose. Nigel Mansell recalls that Senna\u2019s uncompromising attitude was aimed expressly at intimidating other drivers. Verstappen\u2019s wild lunge at Russell in Spain was none of these things. It served no end other than to vent his own anger and has left his title hopes hanging by the slenderest of threads. Worse still it coloured what has otherwise been an enormously impressive season in which he has stayed with the McLarens with immense determination and consistency, taking every opportunity and returning the maximum when he had none. This moment of madness was a pointless flailing that rendered those efforts all but futile and while he maintains he was never really in the title fight, his fearsome efforts thus far this season belie that claim because for all the rightful opprobrium from Sunday, Verstappen is better and more than the driver who gave in to his emotions. His legacy as a potentially great champion depends on him proving that.",

After the race on Sunday, Verstap\u00adpen answered questions about his intent with the dismissive reply: \u201cDoes it \u00admatter?\u201d, and responded to \u00adRussell\u2019s criticism by suggesting sarcastically that the Briton might need a tissue for his tears. But a day later,\u00adVerstappen took a somewhat more conciliatory toneon social media. In a post he said: \u201cWe had an exciting strategy and good race in Barcelona, till the safety car came out. Our tyre choice to the end and some moves after the safety car restart fuelled my frustration, \u00adleading to a move that was not right and shouldn\u2019t have happened. \u201cI always give every\u00adthing out there for the team and emotions can run high. You win some together, you lose some together. See you [at the next race] in Montreal.\u201d Verstappen had found himself stymied on the wrong tyres after a late safety car in Barcelona and with what he admitted was frustration at the sequence of events, including \u00adlosing places and concluding with him having to cede a place to \u00adRussell, he moved over for Russell and then accelerated back up the inside to strike the side of the Mercedes. He was given a 10-second penalty for causing a collision, which the stewards deemed had \u201c\u00adundoubtedly\u201d been caused by his actions. He was also penalised with three points on his racing licence, moving him to 11. One more point at the next two races, in Canada or Austria, will result in an immediate one-race ban. His on-track penalty dropped him to 10th place and he has fallen to 49\u00a0points behind the drivers\u2019 championship leader, Oscar Piastri. Responses from other drivers were generally guarded as they wanted to see what had happened in more detail but McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris did compare Verstappen\u2019s move as something he might try in Mario Kart. They are likely to be more forthcoming at the next round in Montreal, where the incident will undoubtedly be discussed at the drivers\u2019 briefing. Rosberg, on Sky Sports, was clear he felt it was unacceptable. \u201cIt looked like a very intentional retaliation,\u201d he said. \u201cWait for the opponent, go ramming into him, just like you felt the other guy rammed into you at turn one. That\u2019s something which is extremely unacceptable and I think the rules would be a black flag.\u201d Sign up toThe Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend\u2019s action after newsletter promotion The stewards investigated the incident immediately and issued the penalty at the time, so the four-time world champion will not receive any further sanction. The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, argued that it reflected Verstappen\u2019s character. \u201cThe great ones, whether it\u2019s in motor racing or in other sports, you just need to have the world against you and perform at the highest possible level,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cThat\u2019s why sometimes these greats don\u2019t recognise that actually the world is not against you, it\u2019s just you who has made a mistake or screwed up.\u201d During the early part of his career Verstappen was noted as being impetuous and overly aggressive but he has since developed into a more rounded driver. His dominant title wins in 2022 and 2023 were secured with an assured calm. However, Verstappen has proved more volatile when pushed to the limit \u2013 as he was in 2021 by Lewis \u00adHamilton, and during this season where he is \u00adfighting a far superior McLaren car.",

Mason quickly emerged as a leading candidate for the Championship club after theydismissed Tony Mowbrayon 21 April. Spurs\u2019 rollercoaster 2024-25 campaign \u2013 in which theysecured Europa League success\u2013 only ended on 25 May and forced West Brom to bide their time but Mason, after a short holiday, decided to accept their offer and take his first step into management. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely thrilled to have been appointed head coach ofWest Bromwich Albion,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThis is a huge club with a fantastic infrastructure and an incredible fanbase and I am excited about what we can achieve together. \u201cHaving spoken at length to the board and those at the club, I am convinced that Albion is the perfect place for me to be and I can\u2019t wait to get started. I will bring with me a huge amount of enthusiasm, dedication and ambition and look forward to a positive future together at such a fantastic club.\u201d At the age of 33, Mason becomes the youngest head coach in the Championship and the move ends his seven-year coaching career at Tottenham. Mason, who progressed through Spurs\u2019 academy to play 70 times for his boyhood team, was forced tocut short his playing careerin 2018 after he sustained a fractured skull in a Premier League match for Hull at Chelsea a year earlier. Mason held talks with the Belgian club Anderlecht in October before a mutual decision was made to remain at Spurs, which enabled him to play his part in the club\u2019s first trophy since 2008. After two previous caretaker stints at Tottenham, including leading the club inthe 2021 Carabao Cup final, Mason has long been tipped for a future in management. Mason initially started coaching at youth level for Spurs upon his playing retirement before being promoted to Antonio Conte\u2019s coaching staff three years later, not long after a seven-game spell as interim boss.

Mowbray was dismissed in April after their playoff hopes ended despite only being hired in January to replace Carlos Corberan, who left to take over at Valencia.",

        "raw_text": "Jordon Ibe was not supposed to go to the park that day. He reiterates the point several times when recalling the events of 17\u00a0June 2008. Ibe\u2019s mum had forbidden his attendance at Tabard Gardens in Southwark, south-east London, but he went anyway; a kickabout was too much of a draw for the then 12\u2011year\u2011old. That day Ibe witnessed his friend David Idowu being stabbed through the heart. A few weeks later, Idowu died. \u201cI\u2019d not even seen a butter knife,\u201d Ibe says. The cadence of his voice has slowed, his words so soft they are virtually inaudible. \u201cTo see that happen in front of me \u2026 my friend wasn\u2019t about that life. He got stabbed because he had the wrong school uniform on. I saw it and ran out of the park, ran home. I remember seeing myself on the news on the CCTV. \u201cYou don\u2019t really know what to do. It wasn\u2019t like I was going to say anything to my mum because I wasn\u2019t supposed to be there. She didn\u2019t know I\u2019d witnessed a death. I told her a few years later. \u201cI don\u2019t think I really processed it until I was a bit older. I\u2019d not even been in a school fight, but I\u2019d witnessed something like that. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll never forget, but I\u2019ve never really spoken about it. Being so young, you\u2019re not really going to be processing trauma like that.\u201d Ibe was not intending to speak about the tragedy, nor does he raise it to stir sympathy. It comes up naturally during a broad and open conversation on mental health and anxiety, Ibe segueing to his childhood after describing being robbed at gunpoint at the age of 20. He had been tailed from a London hotel one morning and, as he reached Surrey Quays, his car was bumped. It was lunchtime, broad daylight. \u201cI got out not noticing who was in the car,\u201d he says. \u201cThey had balaclavas on. One put a machete to my chest and said: \u2018If\u00a0you move, I\u2019ll stab you.\u2019 Everything happened so fast but slow at the same time. My silly arse tried to get away and the passenger pulled a gun out.\u201d The two incidents are touchstones in Ibe\u2019s life. Their effects are impossible to measure, although he recalls hiding in bushes as a child to avoid running into the wrong people and hired security after the robbery. However, they have not detracted from his trust in humanity or his desire to be a good\u00a0person. Take a little-known story about the winger\u2019s time atBournemouth, for example. Ibe got chatting to a homeless man who had split with his wife and lost contact with his kids. Ibe took him home, stuffed several bags full of clothes, checked the guy into a hotel for a few weeks and bought him a mobile phone so he could contact his children. It was also while on the south coast that Ibe\u2019s mental health hit crisis point. Shortly before the pandemic, Ibe had bought a family home. But after splitting from his partner \u201cit became a home for me\u201d. He was still able to see his young daughter, but it was not the same as living together. Family is everything to Ibe, his little girl his\u00a0world. \u201cThere were a lot of dark times. The house was too big. Being\u00a0by myself was difficult,\u201d he says\u00a0solemnly. Many speak of being able to hide their inner demons, of\u00a0putting on a brave face in public.\u00a0Not Ibe. \u201cPeople could see it in me. I was a bit in denial at first, but deep down I knew.\u201d It reached a point that Ibe was having \u201cthoughts that human beings shouldn\u2019t be having \u2013 you want to live, not be on the other side. If it wasn\u2019t for my path in life with God, especially my daughter, I don\u2019t know what the future would\u00a0have been.\u201d Ibe will eternally be grateful for the intervention of Eddie Howe, his manager at the time. \u201cHe helped me during the hard times \u2013 letting me go to rehab, taking time off football, going to see a\u00a0psychiatrist.\u201d Howe is one of the good men according to Ibe, \u201ca real family guy. Every time I message him, he replies within a day or two. And you know managers are busy.\u201d Ibe recently returned to public consciousness via the Baller League. He is not a former footballer, but a current footballer, even if he has played only 11 minutes professionally \u2013 for Derby and Ebbsfleet \u2013 since his Bournemouth contract expired in June 2020. Still only 29, Ibe was a child prodigy. Aged 15 years and 244 days, he made his debut forWycombein the League Cup. A few months later, in October 2011, he scored on his first start. At school the following Monday his science teacher showed the highlights during class. \u201cEverything came so quick,\u201d Ibe says. \u201cI was in year 10, playing League One. It was crazy.\u201d It does not take long in Ibe\u2019s company to conclude that he would have found that spotlight awkward. But the lights only brightened. Among several Premier League suitors wereLiverpool. He initially turned them down. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t out of disrespect, but I\u2019d never been out of London,\u201d he says. \u201cGoing to the north felt very foreign to me. I wanted to be with my family. It wasn\u2019t \u2018no\u2019 \u2013 it was: \u2018Could we speak about this in a year\u2019s time?\u2019\u201d Sign up toFootball Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion Liverpool waited patiently and when Ibe joined in December 2011 the club helped move his entire family north. A Premier League debut came under Brendan Rodgers in May 2013, with Ibe assisting Philippe Coutinho for the winner. Later that night he was back in London for a kickabout with\u00a0his friends. \u201cI love football and I told them I\u2019d be down,\u201d he\u00a0says matter-of-factly. Loans at Birmingham and Derby followed, the latter spell coming under Steve McClaren, and Ibe did so well that he was recalled by Liverpool in January 2015. The mention of McClaren visibly lifts\u00a0Ibe. \u201cI felt like I was at Real Madrid at Derby,\u201d he says, grinning. \u201cI was gutted when I left \u2013 he\u2019s the best I had. He gave me freedom to play. I was just happy with him. A lot of Derby fans have said if I\u2019d stayed \u2026 well, I just loved it there.\u201d That May Ibe signed a long-term Anfield deal and within weeks Raheem Sterling \u2013 a mentor for Ibe despite being exactly a year older \u2013 joined Manchester City. \u201cI thought it was my time regardless,\u201d Ibe says when asked if he felt that further opened the door. \u201cI was determined to get on the pitch, whether he, or other players, were there or not. I knew I could rise to the standard.\u201d Ibe was flying andafter Rodgers\u2019s October sackinghe featured regularly under J\u00fcrgen Klopp. But the following summer, in a demonstration of just how quickly the football sands shift, everything flipped. \u201cI was kind of pushed out the door,\u201d Ibe says. His reluctance to reveal further details until his career is done is understandable. All Ibe is willing to say is that there was a \u201clot of politics\u201d that he \u201cdidn\u2019t really understand at the time\u201d. \u201cI just had to pick up all my boots and make my way down to Bournemouth.\u201d Did it feel wrong? \u201cYeah. I don\u2019t regret Bournemouth\u00a0but I\u2019m very sensitive. I\u2019ve always been that way. I didn\u2019t think it was right. But life is not like that.\u201d Ibe was Bournemouth\u2019s record signing; a \u00a315m starlet expected to make a huge impact. That is not how it transpired and come the last 18\u00a0months of his four-year contract he felt ostracised. An extension was on the table but his refusal to sign it \u2013 he wanted the control of being a free agent \u2013 meant he was, if not entirely excluded, pushed out. \u201cThey\u2019d spent a lot of money at my age and needed to recoup something. It\u2019s a business. I\u2019m not disrespecting anyone, but I was killing it in training. It wasn\u2019t\u00a0making sense. But I knew the reason.\u201d Last season, Ibe turned out for the non-league sides Hayes & Yeading and Hungerford. For him it was all about feeling part of something again, smelling the grass, being in the dressing room. As for what comes next, Ibe is clear but also coy. \u201cContinue football; reach the levels I know I can hit; give it that one last push,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I regret what\u2019s happened. It\u2019s changed me for the better. Football is not the main accomplishment in my life. I have a deeper purpose; being a dad; being a great human being; being a brother; being a son. More meaningful stuff in life.\u201d Ibe is in conversation with several clubs. \u201cHopefully everything goes my way,\u201d he says. And with that he is off to spend time with his little girl.

        "raw_text": "Australian limited overs great Glenn Maxwell has called time on his decorated one-day international career to focus on next year\u2019s T20 World Cup and domestic competitions as injuries begin to take their toll. The explosive all-rounder announced his retirement from ODIs on Monday after 149 matches that included arguablythe greatest innings of all time in the format. Maxwell amassed 3,990 runs at an average of 33.81 with four centuries, including an unbeaten double ton that lifted Australia to a critical victory over Afghanistan at the 2023CricketWorld Cup. Australia\u2019s World Cup hopes were on the brink of collapse when Maxwell arrived at the crease with the then five-time champions 91 for seven and well short of their 292-run target. Maxwell partnered with Pat Cummins in an incredible 202-run partnership with the all-rounder blasting 10 sixes and 21 boundaries in his 201 not out from 128 balls. The Australia captain contributed only 12 runs to the unbroken partnership as Maxwell took control and turned match-winner with a series of unconventional strokes while suffering from severe cramp in the stifling Mumbai heat. Australia reached Afghanistan\u2019s target with 25 balls to spare and went on to defeat the highly fancied India in the final in Ahmedabad. \u201cI think back to right at the start I was picked ahead of my time and out of the blue,\u201d Maxwell said. \u201cI was just proud just to be playing a couple of games for Australia. I thought I was just going to have that. \u201cSince then, I have been able to go through the up and downs of being dropped, being brought back, playing in a few World Cups and being a part of some great teams.\u201d Maxwell ends his 13-year ODI career with the second highest strike-rate of all men\u2019s batters at 126.7, only behind West Indian powerhouse Andre Russell on 130.22.

        "raw_text": "After overseeing Brighton\u2019s highest Women\u2019s Super League finish, you could forgive Dario Vidosic for being in a celebratory mood. But that is not his style. \u201cI\u2019m not too interested about being the best of the rest, I want to be the best of the best,\u201d he says at the end of his first season in English football. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be our mentality, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to strive to achieve.\u201d Brighton finished fifth, eclipsing everyone except the so-called \u201cbig four\u201d. Doing so has proved to be something of a curse in recent years; in 2021, Everton dropped to 10th the following season while in 2022, Tottenham were ninth a year later. After finishing fourth in 2024, Liverpoolparted ways with their manager, Matt Beard, in February and dropped down to seventh. Vidosic is keen to not only ensure no such drop-off is repeated by his side but that they keep pushing forward and challenge for silverware. \u201cWe want to build, we don\u2019t want to be a one-off where we have a good season and then we fall. We\u2019ve set that platform now. \u201cWe\u2019ve not achieved anything yet. We have to be proud of what we\u2019ve achieved. For me, I\u2019d have loved to have done a bit more. \u201cAt the start I said we want to win trophies and compete in all competitions. We\u2019re trying to win, we\u2019re trying to build towards that. We go out every game with the intention to play our football, to try to get the three points. Until it\u2019s mathematically impossible or until we get knocked out of a certain competition, that [winning] is always the goal. That\u2019s how we train, that\u2019s the mindset we try to instil. \u201cWe want to make real history for the club and bring a trophy. We weren\u2019t able to do that this year but that\u2019ll be the ambition again next season.\u201d Brighton\u2019s home form has been key to their improvement. Only Liverpool and Manchester City managed to win there. Chelsea and Manchester United were held to draws, while Arsenal, nowthe European champions, were beaten 4-2 at the Broadfield Stadium last month. Under Vidosic, Brighton have developed a modern playing style: they were ranked fourth in the WSL for possession and had the fifth-highest number of touches in their opponents\u2019 penalty area. Only Arsenal had a greater shot-conversion percentage. \u201cAs a player, I always loved to have the ball,\u201d Vidosic says. \u201cWhen I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d try to run off to press to win it back so it stems a little bit from my playing days. I always wanted to have the ball at my feet. It\u2019s the sort of football I think is enjoyable for the players. \u201cIt needs to be enjoyable, the way we play. It\u2019s something I want people to enjoy, to say: \u2018We like to watch your team play football, we want to sacrifice our weekends, we want to travel crazy hours to all parts of the country to watch you and we know we\u2019re going to watch a good game of football.\u2019 That\u2019s really important.\u201d Sign up toMoving the Goalposts No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women\u2019s football after newsletter promotion Vidosic deployed the same style in his first managerial job, coaching Melbourne City to the 2024 A-League Women title. That success caught Brighton\u2019s eye and their approach last summer took the Croatia-born former Australia and Adelaide United winger by surprise. \u201cIt all happened very, very quickly over the course of three or four nights, and then after that was told they would like to offer me the job and then the visa process, that took some time. \u201cIt\u2019s more true in this day and age \u2013 where you just never know who\u2019s watching. That\u2019s something I always say to my players \u2013 your life can change sometimes with one game. If you do the right thing, you work hard, it doesn\u2019t matter where in the world you are, that opportunity might come.\u201d For the 38-year-old and his young family it was a big decision but one he is evidently glad he took. \u201cI was excited with the project and also wanting to test myself in what\u2019s regarded as the best league in the world,. I felt I was ready. I thank them very much for taking a risk on a young coach to give me an opportunity. \u201cIt\u2019s an ambitious, supportive club, especially of the women\u2019s game.

The president of the FWC, Justice Adam Hatcher, said the decision would help claw back the loss of real incomes over the past few years, even as employer groups warned many smaller businesses would struggle the afford the \u201cgenerous\u201d pay rise. The new minimum wage from July will be $24.95 an hour, or $948 per week, up from $24.10 and $915.90, respectively \u2013 a weekly increase of about $32. Anthony Albanese noted the decision was about 1 percentage point higher than the current rate of inflation, saying the result \u201cwill be welcomed by people who keep our economy going, the essential workers who need this wage increase in real terms\u201d. Nearly 3 million employees, or one in five, have their pay set by an award and will be directly affected by the annual minimum wage determination. Affected workers are concentrated in labour-intensive and female-dominated industries such as hospitality, health and social assistance, and administrative services. The number of Australians paid the minimum wage, however, is a fraction of that - below 100,000 people, according to government estimates. The annual determination delivered on Tuesday morning was quickly welcomed by the peak unions body, but was criticised by business groups who had argued for an increase of 2-2.5%. The Reserve Bank recently projected inflation will climb from 2.4% in the year to March, to 3.1% by mid-2026 following the end of government cost of living measures, such as energy subsidies. Hatcher said the \u201cinflation spike\u201d had particularly hurt lower-paid workers, and that fears of further fueling inflation had informed minimum wage decisions in recent years. But with inflation back under control, Hatcher said it was time to make up for that hit to living standards, adding that \u201cwe are satisfied that the level of wage increase we have determined is sustainable\u201d. \u201cThe principal consideration which has guided our decision is the fact that since July 2021, employees who are reliant upon modern award minimum wages, or the national minimum wage, have suffered a reduction in the real value of their wage rates,\u201d he said when handing down the decision. \u201cThis provides us with an opportunity to go at least some of the way towards correcting what has happened over the last four years by awarding a real increase to modern award wages and the national minimum wage.\u201d \u201cWe are concerned that if this opportunity is not taken in this annual wage review, a loss in the real value of wages which has occurred will become permanently embedded in the modern award system and the national minimum wage, and a reduction of living standards for the lowest paid in the community will thereby be entrenched.\u201d The RBA governor, Michele Bullock, has said the bank anticipates inflation will settle at around the middle of the 2-3% target range over the coming two years. ACTU secretary Sally McManus credited union pressure and the Albanese government\u2019s advocacy for the real minimum wage rise. \u201cThis wage increase means those who are paid award wages will start to get ahead again, easing pressure on their weekly budgets and part of the stress that comes from having to cut back on the basics,\u201d McManus said in a statement. The government had argued in favour of a decision that did not send workers\u2019 wages backwards, and the final result falls between the competing demands from the peak union body and business groups. The chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Andrew McKellar, said \u201cwe think this increase is a generous increase for employees\u201d and that \u201cthis decision is being delivered against a backdrop of declining productivity\u201d. Business groups such as ACCI had made the case for an increase of around 2.5% or lower, arguing that firms were struggling with sharp increases in operating costs. Economists said the minimum pay rise would not prevent the RBA from delivering further rate cuts this year, although RBC Capital chief economist Su-Lin Ong said the increase \u201cerrs a little high from an economic and sustainability lens\u201d. The FWC, in its ruling, said Australia\u2019s ongoing poor productivity performance had \u201crestrained\u201d the size of minimum pay rises. \u201cCertainly, the productivity problem will not be resolved by the indefinite continuation of the reduction in real wages which has occurred over the last four years,\u201d it said.

        "raw_text": "Six months of natural disasters in 2025 have cost the economy $2.2bn, largely in slower retail and household spending, according to new federal Treasury analysis. Wild weather has repeatedly battered the Australian east coast this year. The analysis period covers Cyclone Alfred, the first cyclone to hit south-east Queensland in 50 years,and associated flooding. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email It also includes the impact of last month\u2019s severe flooding in New South Wales\u2019s Hunter and mid-north coast regions. The disaster left about 10,000 buildings with flood damage, withan estimated 1,000uninhabitable, and claimed five lives. Outbackandnorth Queenslandalso flooded this year. Australia\u2019s land surface haswarmed by 1.5C since 1910and the climate crisis has increased the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including flooding. Treasury expects most of the immediate loss in economic activity to take place in the March quarter. Partial data for the March quarter has shown that retail trade and household spending have been the most significantly impacted as a result of the disasters. Nominal retail trade inQueenslandfell 0.3% in February and 0.4% in March, according to Treasury analysis. Household spending was flat, with a 0.2% drop in Queensland.

Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion \u201cThe human impacts matter to us most, but the economic cost is very significant too, and we\u2019ll see that in Wednesday\u2019s national accounts,\u201d said the treasurer,Jim Chalmers. \u201cThe government will be there for people in disaster-hit regions, just like they\u2019re there for each other. \u201cWe\u2019ve activated disaster assistance to the Hunter and mid-north coast regions of NSW, just as we did earlier in the year in Queensland and northern NSW.\u201d The treasurer said the economic progress Australians had made lowering inflation, debt and unemployment meant \u201cwe\u2019re in a stronger position to provide support when communities need it most\u201d. The federal government hasannounced several rounds of disaster payments. The minister for emergency management, Kristy McBain, said it planned to fund projects designed to improve preparedness and resilience in order to protect communities when disasters strike. \u201cWe are committed to funding support to increase resilience, adaptability and preparedness,\u201d she said. \u201cOur disaster ready fund initiative will provide another $200m of investment in 2025-26.\u201d McBain said she had been on the ground in NSW, where she saw \u201cfirst-hand the effects a disaster can have\u201d, and had been meeting with small businesses and primary producers that had been \u201chit hard\u201d. \u201cIt is my priority to work closely with all levels of government to ensure support is provided as quickly as possible,\u201d she said. McBain said the federal government would \u201ccontinue to work with NSW on any other funding requests\u201d. \u201cFor a lot of these people, it\u2019s the cumulative impact of a number of events, and we understand that,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why recovery isn\u2019t going to be over the next couple of days when cameras and lights are on the area. It\u2019s going to be days, weeks and months that we\u2019ll walk with these communities.\u201d",

        "raw_text": "Australia\u2019s trade minister, Don Farrell, has described Donald Trump\u2019strade tariffsas \u201cunjustified and not the act of a friend\u201d, after the US president announced he would doubleimport duties on steel and aluminiumto 50%. Trump told a steelworkers rally in Pittsburgh that raising the tariff would \u201ceven further secure the steel industry in the United States. Nobody is going to get around that\u201d. Ina social media poston Saturday, Trump clarified the increase from 25% to 50% would be effective from 4 June and would apply to steel and aluminium. Australia exports relatively little steel to the US. About 2.5% of US aluminium imports by volume come from Australia, but this is less than 10% of Australia\u2019s total exports of the metal. Reiterating Australia\u2019s stance on the tariffs, Farrell said in a statement on Saturday: \u201cAustralia\u2019s position has been consistent and clear. These tariffs are unjustified and not the act of a friend. \u201cThey are an act of economic self-harm that will only hurt consumers and businesses who rely on free and fair trade. We will continue to engage and advocate strongly for the removal of the tariffs.\u201d Speaking later on Saturday afternoon, Farrell said Australia was calling on Trump to reverse the decision and to drop all tariffs, but said there would be no retaliatory steps. \u201cWhat we need to do now is to convince the Americans that this is, in fact, the wrong course of action,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the wrong policy. It simply pushes up prices for American consumers. And that\u2019s not good for the Americans. And it\u2019s certainly not good for Australian steel and aluminium producers.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The shadow trade minister, Kevin Hogan, said on Saturday that Trump\u2019s announcement was concerning for Australian jobs. \u201cThe Albanese government needs to double its efforts to protect our steel industry and local jobs for our steelworkers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect the United States to honour its obligations under the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement, just as Australia has always done. The strength of our economic partnership has been built on trust and mutual benefit, and any deviation from this agreement undermines the principles of free trade.\u201d Hogan said the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, needed to personally meet Trump during the G7 talks in Canada taking place in two weeks \u201cto develop a personal rapport with the United States president and protect Australian industries\u201d. Hogan said: \u201cThe Coalition want the government to succeed because that is in the national interest.\u201d Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs were initially blocked by a US court this week, which ruled them illegal, before the administrationwon a temporary pause on that ruling on Thursday. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion It is understood a national security provision \u2013 section 232 of theTrade Expansion Act\u2013 does give the US president authority to unilaterally raise tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Marghanita Johnson, the chief executive of the Australian Aluminium Council, said a key concern was the potential for international trade flows to be distorted. The council would keep working with the government, she said. Mark Cain, the chief executive of industry group the Australian Steel Institute, said the increase in tariffs was disappointing. He said: \u201cOne of the concerns we have is that the subsequent disruptions to global steel trade could see Australia become a dumping ground for imported steel. And it could exacerbate the surge in imported low-priced steel that is damaging the industry.\u201d In March, when the steel tariffs came into force, BlueScope Steel, which exports about 300,000 tonnes of steel a year to the US, said it was disappointed the industry had not received the same tariff exemption that was negotiated during Trump\u2019s first term. The company produces more than 3m tonnes of steel each year at its Ohio plant. BlueScope said at the time it was working closely with the Australian government\u2019s trade and diplomatic staff \u201cto ensure the BlueScope investment proposition is fully understood\u201d. Australian economist Prof Justin Wolfers, of the University of Michigan, told Guardian Australia the steel tariffs would probably have little effect on Australian industry, as demand for steel globally should allow companies to find other customers. He said: \u201cWe are talking about very small numbers of people [who work in the steel industry in the US]. But steel is used as an input for a broad array of manufacturing jobs. Steel will be more expensive \u2013 even American steel.\u201d Wolfers pointed toprevious analysis of the impact of 2018 steel tariffsduring the first Trump administration, which found they created about 1,000 more steel jobs but about 75,000 jobs were lost from the wider manufacturing sector. Asked why Trump was implementing the increase, Wolfers said: \u201cThere are some questions better directed to a psychologist than an economist. Trump likes tariffs.\u201d",

Farmers given temporary reprieve from Victorian emergency services levy Farmers will be temporarily spared from paying a hikedemergency services levyas drought support is expanded statewide in Victoria,AAPreports. An extra $37.7m has been earmarked for drought relief in Victoria as paddocks and dams run dry after low autumn rainfall. A Victorian drought relief package, which includes $5000 grants, will be made available across the state after previously being limited to 24 local government areas. Its expansion means all farmers will not pay the increased rate for the expanded emergency services levy in the 2025-26 financial year. Their rate will remain at the same level as 2024-25 and automatically applied to notices for primary production properties. The expansion of drought support was based on Bureau of Meteorology and Agriculture Victoria advice that the worse case for May rainfall had been realised, the premier,Jacinta Allan, said. \u201cAll of Victoria is being now recognised as being affected by drought,\u201d she told reporters in Fiskville on Friday. Under the original changes to the levy from 1 July, the average annual bill was expected to rise $678 for primary producers and $63 for residential homeowners. Spooked by the backlash, the Allan government lowered the rate for farmers and introduced rebates for CFA and SES volunteers and life members. The expanded levy was meant raise an extra $2.1bn over the next three years to cover more emergency service agencies in the face of more frequent and intense natural disasters. The treasurer,Jaclyn Symes, said the recent tweaks would leave the budget $73m worse off but she remained confident of delivering an operating surplus of $600m in 2025-26. Parents warned of overdose from over-the-counter medicines Parents grabbing over-the-counter medicine to help their children is causing a startling number of hospital visits, researchers say. AAPreports almost 100 children and teenagers are being taken to emergency departments every day after taking over-the-counter medicines such as paracetamol and antidepressants. At least half of these visits are preventable due to being accidental or intentional overdoses or adult-only medication, University of South Australia researchers said. The Royal Children\u2019s Hospital emergency medicine director says intentional overdoses can be particularly concerning. \u201c[Paracetamol] is one of the scary medications where early on, there may be very minimal symptoms,\u201dDr Stuart Lewenatold AAP. It\u2019s only going to be when the paracetamol is starting to cause damage to the liver [when] we\u2019ll start to see symptoms of nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In the case of accidental ingestions, he said parents and carers can be \u201cflustered, anxious, worried about the error they\u2019ve made\u201d, delaying treatment. Lewena said hospitals are stretched and urged parents to keep medication out of children\u2019s reach. Parents should particularly keep an eye on prescription medications as one tablet can cause harm to children. Kids are incredibly resourceful at getting to things that they know they\u2019re not meant to get to. It\u2019s worthwhile having a discussion with your pharmacist or doctor to know \u2026 \u2018how risky is this in my household?\u2019 In February, the federal government changed the number of paracetamol tablets per pack from 20 to 16 in general stores and 50 in pharmacy medicine packs. Queensland government say nurses union hasn\u2019t made pay counteroffer Queensland\u2019s state government says the nurses union has not put forward a counteroffer after rejecting a pay offer this week. SecretarySarah Beamanannounced earlier today that the Queensland Nurses and Midwives Union is \u201clikely\u201d to start industrial action next week. Stage one is likely to consist of things like wearing campaign shirts and badges. It is the first strike action by the union in 23 years. A spokesperson for the health minister,Tim Nicholls, said the government would \u201ccontinue to negotiate in good faith with the union\u201d. It\u2019s disappointing that the union has rejected two offers that fulfil the government\u2019s election commitment to deliver national-leading wages and conditions for our nurses and midwives. We will continue to negotiate in good faith with the union. To date, a counteroffer has not been put forward by the union. Liberals \u2018lost sight of\u2019 culture of constructive debate and openness to being challenged: Archer Bridget Archersaid a culture of being able to talk frankly and disagree with colleagues in the party may have diminished in the last term as a result of the turnover of Liberal leaders during the last Coalition government, and the sense of a need for discipline. I think \u2026 we lost sight of the fact that we need to have these disagreements, we need to have constructive debates, we need to be open to being challenged and criticised and to challenge and criticise other views. Archer said the Liberal party also needs to examine how it speaks to electorates across the country and the diversity of people it seeks to represent. She said the Liberal party put too much emphasis on the no vote in the voice referendum as a signal on how people might vote in the federal election. Archer said she wouldn\u2019t rule out a future in politics but \u201cnot at the moment\u201d. Former Liberal MP Bridget Archer says party needs \u2018to get back to what it means to be Liberals\u2019 The former Liberal MPBridget Archer, who lost her seat in the federal election earlier this month, has said the Liberal party needs to reassert its own brand, and while the Coalition is important, the Liberals and Nationals need to be two distinct parties. She told ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing: I think that that\u2019s been lost somewhere along the way, possibly with that formal alliance of the LNP in Queensland. Whereas here in Tasmania, for example, where I am, there really hasn\u2019t been able to be a Nationals presence established. We still have, I think, a very strong Liberal brand here and I think that\u2019s been something I have been saying for a long time, that we need to get back to what it means to be Liberals. Not going one way or the other, but actually just getting back to our sort of core values which, yes, probably and we have been most electorally successful has been in the centre. Archer said comments that the Coalition should pull out of net zero do not land well with her: What we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of is not whether we have a commitment to net zero or not, it\u2019s what we do to achieve that emissions reduction that is so important and necessary. So, we can spend a lot of time arguing about the ideology of these things or we can just get on and develop a serious plan to actually deal with the problem. Marles says ASPI report recommending more defence spending not \u2018deep in analysis\u2019 The defence minister,Richard Marles, has described an Australian Strategic Policy Institute report on defence spending as \u201cnot a report which is particularly intellectually satisfying or, at the end of the day, ultimately deep in analysis\u201d. There has been a war of words exchanged between the Albanese government and the thinktank since it concluded that the level of defence spending in this year\u2019s federal budget would make Australia less secure. Marles told ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing: What we saw, in my view with the ASPI report is not a report which is particularly intellectually satisfying or at the end of the day ultimately deep in analysis \u2026. It is the easiest thing in the world to go out there and say that you should spend more \u2013 in fact, we are; we are spending significantly more. There [are] references to the impact of inflation; well, the impact of inflation is built into what we spend and what we are spending is way beyond inflation, but at the end of the day you only have to look at what we inherited from the former Coalition government which was $42bn worth of unfunded projects. He said the Albanese government is fixing up \u201cthe mess\u201d and moving forward with a very clear, strategic direction on defence. He said ASPI should be held accountable for its conclusions, and analysis needed to be \u201cdeep and thoughtful\u201d and \u201cobjective\u201d. Port of Darwin ownership did not come up in discussions with Hegseth: Marles Richard Marlessaid getting the Port of Darwin back in Australian hands did not come up in his discussions withHegseth. When asked about aid cuts made by the Trump administration, Marles said he wouldn\u2019t go into the extent of what was spoken about in the discussion. He said development assistance is one means to provide stability and security in our region, but it isn\u2019t the only means. He said the previous Trump administration made a significant contribution to supporting Pacific Island countries. So I think the importance of those countries is well understood and again, we see ourselves very much as partners with the United States and how we can move forward in that. MarlessaidHegsethdid raise the issue of defence spending, but Marles said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t put a number on it\u201d, when asked whether the US wanted Australia to raise defence spending to 3% of GDP, as the US has asked of its allies. Marles said Australia is raising defence spending. He said the Australian government was open to discussion about more defence spending. We have done a lot already. But we are absolutely up for having this conversation and we want to calibrate our defence spending to meet the strategic moment that we all face. I said this lots of times. In a rational world, defence spending is a function of strategic threat. There is definitely strategic threat in the world today and we are rational people. Marles says Aukus moving forward and meeting timelines after meeting with US counterpart Pete Hegseth The defence minister,Richard Marles, says he has a sense of optimism about the Australia-US relationship after meeting his US counterpart,Pete Hegseth, at the Shangri Dialogue in Singapore earlier today. Marles told ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing: We talked about the shared challenge we had in terms of providing security and stability within the Indo-Pacific, how we can work more closely together to do that and obviously we work very closely together right now, and to try and make our contribution to an Indo-Pacific which is underpinned by the values that Australia and the United States shares which is democracy and the rule of law, but it is a really good meeting, it built on the meeting that we had in February of this year in Washington DC, and it certainly leaves me with a sense of optimism about how we can very much work together to take this agenda forward. He said they talked about the development of Aukus as critical to the collective security of the Indo-Pacific. He said Aukus is moving forward and meeting its timelines. It is a great opportunity for both of our countries and there are a whole lot of challenges in this, obviously, and we are certainly far from sanguine about meeting all of those challenges but fundamentally, Aukus is happening and we talked about how we need to maintain the momentum of that. The federal budget deficit is already running $4.8bn better than expected in the financial year to April, according to the Department of Finance\u2019s latest monthly statements. To be clear: the nation\u2019s finances are still in the red, just not as deeply as anticipated a couple of months ago. The March 25 budget forecast an underlying cash deficit of $24bn in the first 10 months of 2024-25. But the departmental figures show the actual deficit for the period came in at $19.2bn. The rapid improvement was powered by corporate taxes coming in $3.2bn better than anticipated, the statements show. High commodity prices may explain the larger than anticipated tax take on profits: the iron ore price is still sky high, trading at about $US96 a tonne, despite the global jitters caused by Trump\u2019s tariffs. The March budget predicted last financial year\u2019s surplus of $15.8bn would flip to a $27.6bn deficit in 2024-25 \u2013 the start of a string of deficits. \u201cThe budgetary bad news is arriving more slowly than Treasury and Finance forecast,\u201d the independent economist,Chris Richardson, said. Victorian Liberal deputy rejects claims of taxpayer-funded car rort A tennis ace turned Liberal hot shot is staring down calls to quit, rejecting allegations of a drunken, taxpayer-funded car rort,AAPreports.Victorian Liberal deputySam Grothused then-opposition upper house leaderGeorgie Crozier\u2019s chauffeur-driven vehicle to take him and his wife home from the Australian Open in January 2024.The trip from Melbourne Park to Rye on the Mornington Peninsula is about 100km.The former tennis player had earlier hosted a political fundraiser with Nationals MPJade Benham.Groth and Benham, along with their respective spouses, then entered a party zone inside the tennis precinct, the Herald Sun reports.The former Davis Cup representative was accused of getting \u201csmashed\u201d and misleading Crozier by telling her he wanted to borrow the car for a work event.He was shadow minister for tourism, sport and events at the time and elected the party\u2019s deputy leader in December afterJohn Pesuttolost the leadership toBrad Battin.In a statement on Friday, Groth confirmed he attended the event in both an official and personal capacity. I was at the event to meet various stakeholders and attend meetings before being part of a fundraising initiative.The accusations around intoxication are wrong. Groth argued it was all officially disclosed and he had \u201cnothing to hide\u201d, but the travel allowance entry on his register of interest does not specifically mention the fundraiser.Battin firmly stood by his deputy when asked if he should resign.Victoria\u2019s ministerial code of conduct says public resources must not be used for \u201cimproper personal or private advantage or benefit for themselves or any other person\u201d, or for political party purposes. Queensland nurses \u2018likely\u2019 to start industrial action next week Queensland nurses and midwives are \u201clikely\u201d to start industrial action next week, after rejecting a revised pay offer from the state government today. Nurses union secretarySarah Beamansaid stage one of industrial action would include things like wearing campaign shirts and badges. The union\u2019s 55,000 members operate in public health facilities such as hospitals and QueenslandHealthclinics statewide. \u201cWe are preparing to commence protected industrial action as early as next week,\u201d Beaman said. More than 96% of those who voted said yes to taking protected industrial action to protect patients and their colleagues. Protected industrial action will likely begin in Queensland health facilities statewide next week. I would like to remind Queensland that patients and aged care resident safety remains paramount during protected industrial action which has been approved by the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission. Union members rejected a state government pay offer and voted to take industrial action this week. The state government updated its offer, but the union said it remains \u201csubpar\u201d and would reduce rights and conditions. \u201cThe government threatened us with the removal of eight weeks\u2019 backpay if we didn\u2019t accept this substandard offer by close of business today. However, we continue to stand strong for a fair agreement and the backpay the government owes us,\u201d Beaman said. The nurses union hasn\u2019t walked off the job since 2002. It will give three days\u2019 notice of any industrial action. The week of media news is here withAmanda Meade\u2019s Weekly Beast. Hanson welcomes One Nation\u2019s best ever election results Pauline Hansonhas welcomed her party\u2019s best ever election result, with a fourth senator confirmed elected today. The newly electedWarwick Staceyin NSW andTyron Whittenin Western Australia join Hanson and the re-electedMalcolm Robertsin Queensland, taking the One Nation contingent to four in the Senate. That equals the party\u2019s best result in the 2016 double-dissolution election. Hanson: Our national vote increased significantly across Australia at this election thanks to a strong campaign with great candidates, common sense policies and dedicated volunteers.There is no more dedicated servant of Queensland than Malcolm Roberts and he\u2019s seen off challengers from all sides to be re-elected yet again. I\u2019m also delighted that Tyron Whitten and Warwick Stacey will be joining us on the Senate crossbench. They both have much to offer their respective states and they are great additions to our team.This team will continue the work we have always done in parliament on behalf of the Australian people: hold this toxic Labor government to account; raise the important issues; embody the strong conservative values that built this nation; defend our democracy, rights and freedoms; and put our country and its people first. In his first comments since being elected, Whitten said: I\u2019m looking forward to representing the people of WA and standing for the values that make this country great. That\u2019s all for me today, I\u2019ll leave you withJosh Taylorwho will guide you through the rest of today\u2019s news. Take care. Flood warnings for parts of South Australia The BoM has issuedflood warningsfor parts of South Australia, saying river levels remain elevated as flood waters from the Warburton River reach parts of Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre. Floodwaters may cut roads and access tracks, and in particular river crossings, impacting travel in the region. TheSA SES added flooding is likely to remain in the area for a few months, and warned those in the area to take care as the water recedes as roads may have been damaged. You can read more here:",

The 24-year-old died after being restrained by police who intervened during an altercation at a Coles supermarket. McCarthy told ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing: Even the high rates of incarceration of First Nations people is a matter of concern across Australia, but especially here in the Northern Territory.

Chaney told Afternoon Briefing: Like any project, it should go ahead when it stacks up and takes into account environmental, cultural issues and climate impact. This has not taken into account climate impact \u2026 This is a project that is being approved through 2070,when my kids will be grandparents, and I just don\u2019t buy that this is a necessary decision to make now, given what we know about the climate impact of the project.

You can read more here: The Australian Electoral Commission hasconfirmed upper house results in WA and Queensland today, with exactly the same results in both states: With six seats on offer in each, both have elected two Labor, two Coalition, one Green andone from One Nation. In QLD, the LNP\u2019s Paul Scarr was first elected, alongside colleague Susan McDonald; Nita Green from Labor was elected second, alongside Corinne Mulholland. Larissa Waters, the Greens leader, came fifth and Pauline Hanson\u2019s deputyMalcolm Roberts came in sixth position. In WA, Labor\u2019s Ellie Whiteaker was first elected, alongside Varun Ghosh; Slade Brockman for the Liberals was second, with Matt O\u2019Sullivan; the Greens\u2019 Jordon Steele-John was re-elected in fourth spot, with Whitten coming sixth. It will take One Nation to three senators, alongside Hanson who is up for election next term. Whitten, according to a bio on One Nation\u2019s website, \u201cbelieves in a strong national energy policy that prioritises Australian resources, making power more affordable and reliable. He will also fight to end the reckless mass immigration policies that are driving up housing costs and putting immense strain on infrastructure and essential services\u201d. The bio adds: Our government is selling out Australians with policies that benefit corporations and global bureaucracies while leaving our own people struggling. It\u2019s time to put Australians first. Ayres says Albanese will stand up for Australia if he speaks with Donald Trump at G7 next month The ABC\u2019s Patricia Karvelas asked Ayres how the prime minister will advocate for the country after the tariff ruling at next month\u2019s G7 summit in Canada. He said: I think what you\u2019d expect to see is Anthony Albanese as the Australian prime minister standing up for Australia\u2019s interest in a calm and consistent way. It certainly won\u2019t be, as you say, begging any global leader for anything. We do things the Australian way here. Tim Ayres says Labor will keep pushing Australian interests after US court blocks Trump tariffs Industry and science minister Tim Ayres said the Labor government would continue to focus on advancing Australia\u2019s interests, saying he wasreluctant to commentona recent court rulingthat blocked US president Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cliberation day\u201d tariffs. Ayers said the most \u201csensible\u201d approach would be to wait and see what happens in the US court system rather than get too excited by the move, adding to the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing: What we want to do is keep squarely focused on Australia\u2019s interest \u2026 [The tariffs are] an unwelcome development in terms of the bilateral relationship, the bilateral economic relationship, but what I\u2019m concerned about as well, and the government is concerned about, is the impact on the rules-based order and the global trading system that Australia relies upon so much. Queensland begins review of puberty blockers Queensland\u2019s review of puberty blockers has begun.HealthministerTim Nichollsbanned all public prescribing of puberty blockers for transgender children in January. They are still available for cisgender children. He also ordered a review to be led by psychiatrist Ruth Vine. It will inquire into \u201cthe strength of the evidence base for using Stage 1 and Stage 2 hormones to treat gender dysphoria\u201d among other things. According to its terms of reference, the review \u201cmay consider\u201d published grey literature, including the Cass Review which led to a ban on prescribing puberty blockers in the United Kingdom. A review completed last yearrecommended the state government double fundingfor the Brisbane-based Queensland Children\u2019s Gender Service and improve regional coverage. Nicholls has announced the government will not implement its recommendations. A range of health bodies including the Australian Medical Association called for the ban to be lifted. Queensland Health director general David Rosengren said the state government had commissioned an independent review because \u201cthe evidence supporting the use of these therapies is contested\u201d. Public consultation was opened today. It closes on 29 July. The review is due to be completed by 30 November.

Australia has thehighest rates of bowel cancer in people under 50in the world, with early-onset cases in that demographic rising by up to 8% a year. It\u2019s thedeadliest cancerfor Australians aged 25 to 44, and experts say it\u2019s important to raise awareness about the signs and symptoms that are often dismissed. The most common signs and symptoms of early-onset bowel cancer are blood in the stool, abdominal pain, a change in bowel habits and unexplained weight loss.So who\u2019s eligible for screening? The Guardian\u2019s Natasha May has more here: Victorian branch of AMWU calls for Labor to recognise Palestinian statehood The Victorian branch of the Australian Manufacturing Workers\u2019 Union (AMWU) has called for the Albanese Labor governmentto recognise Palestinian statehoodand redouble efforts to call for a ceasefire in Gaza \u2013 adding to growing public comments from inside the Labor tent for more action. We\u2019ve reported in recent days on Labor grassroots members urging the government to go further,including considering sanctions on Israel and recognising Palestine. Former foreign ministers Bob Carr and Gareth Evans have also lent their weight to such calls. The state secretary of the Victorian branch of the Australian Manufacturing Workers\u2019 Union (AMWU),Tony Mavromatis, said the Labor government should move toward recognition of Palestinian statehood, sanctions on the Netanyahu government, an increase in humanitarian aid and for a genuine ceasefire in Gaza. Mavromatis said: Now that the Albanese Labor government has been re-elected with a large majority, it is the opportune time to take a bold stand on this and other issues. We just came out of a highly contested election where the Palestinian issue featured prominently. My members see the result as an endorsement of Labor\u2019s policy on Palestine, which calls for recognition before a solution is reached. As a union that has been active and vocal on Palestine, we lend our support to all those within the Labor caucus and movement to urge the prime minister and the foreign minister to announce Australia\u2019s recognition of Palestinian statehood at next month\u2019s UN high-level conference co-hosted by France and Saudi Arabia. Mavromatis said AMWU members weresupportive of sanctions on individuals and institutions guilty of human rights violations, and backed protests against the Netanyahu government. He added: The Australian Labor government needs to persist with calling for the immediate and genuine ceasefire in Gaza, an end of encroachment by Israeli settlers, militia and military into the West Bank, the full reinstatement and increase of humanitarian aid to Gaza and the West Bank, including the continued stabilization of UNWRA, and respect for international law and human rights.

More than 7,000 insurance claims from NSW regions affected by floods Insurers have received more than 7,000 claims from the mid north coast and Hunter regions affected by floods, the Insurance Council of Australia says. There were about 6,000 claimsyesterday. \u201cClaims numbers have been steadily increasing over the past week as residents and business owners have been able to get back into properties to assess the damage and begin the clean-up,\u201d ICA said in a statement. The Insurance Council and insurers are focused on assisting communities in the recovery and have prioritised making clean-up and claims guidance as accessible as possible. This includes direct text messages to policyholders, updates in insurer apps, and having representatives on the ground in centres across the region. There are now Insurance Hubs in Taree and Port Macquarie. Inside the Bradfield recount: painstaking and polite, but sometimes heartbreaking The Bradfield recount is being held in a warehouse in Asquith that appears to have been used for a number of northern Sydney electorates, but on my visit only Bradfield is being counted. A space is set aside as a break room for scrutineers, with large teams for the teal candidate,Nicolette Boele,and the Liberal,Gisele Kapterian,whofinished just eight votes aheadafter the first complete count. Given there weremore than 6,500 informal votes in Bradfield(5.51% of those cast), the potential for decisions over validity to settle the outcome are obvious. Each candidate has at least enough scrutineers to have one watching every person counting. The regular counting space is divided into a series of bays. Each bay is dealing with one polling place at a time. The first part of the process is to conduct a fresh first-preference count. Ballot papers are already in bundles of 50, in first preference order. Each counter takes one bundle at a time and removes the rubber band, then carefully checks each ballot to ensure it is formal and that the first preference is correct. It is then laid on a pile facing the scrutineers, who can observe it. This process happens more slowly and carefully than you would expect for an election night count. Read the full story: Winter will be warmer and in some places wetter than average this year, the Bureau of Meteorology says. \u201cWhile winter is a time for cooler weather, the winter long-range forecast shows day and night temperatures are likely to be above average across Australia for this time of the year,\u201d BoM said in its forecast. Rainfall is also expected to be above average for interior and central parts of the country, while parts of the tropical north, south-east and south-west will see rainfall in the typical range. This includes in parts of South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania that have been affected by prolonged dry conditions as well as parts of New South Wales recently impacted by severe flooding, BoM said. This winter forecast follows an autumn which was much wetter than average in the north and east of Australia, and much drier than average in many southern parts. There is also an \u201cunseasonal increased riskof fire this winter\u201d across parts of South Australia and Victoria.",

        "raw_text": "Australia will continue to push Donald Trump to abandon his administration\u2019s tariff regime entirely, after aUS court blocked the president\u2019s \u201cliberation day\u201d tariffsfrom coming into effect. The Manhattan-based court of international trade said the US constitution gives the Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other countries, and ruled that power was not superseded by the president\u2019s self-declared \u201cemergency\u201d he cited to safeguard the US economy. The Trump White House filed an appeal against the judgment minutes after it was handed down. The regime imposed a10% across-the-board tariff on all Australian importsto the US. Several specific products, includingsteelandaluminium, are subject to higher tariff rates, up to 25%, which are not impacted by the court\u2019s ruling. The Australian trade minister, Don Farrell, said the Australian government would agitate for tariffs on Australian goods to be dumped entirely. \u201cWe will study this ruling of the US Federal Courts on reciprocal tariffs closely and note that they may be subject to further legal processes through the courts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Albanese Government has been consistent in the view that these tariffs on Australian imports into the US are unjustified,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cWe will continue to engage and strongly advocate for the removal of tariffs.\u201d \u201cThe Albanese Government will always stand up for Australia\u2019s national interests, including Australian jobs and Australian industries.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The US court found Trump overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board tariffs on imports from countries all over the world.Trump called the tariffs, announced on 2 April,America\u2019s \u201cliberation day\u201d. \u201cThe court does not pass upon the wisdom or likely effectiveness of the President\u2019s use of tariffs as leverage. That use is impermissible not because it is unwise or ineffective, but because (federal law) does not allow it,\u201d a three-judge panel said in the decision. The ruling came in a pair of lawsuits, one filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small US businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties and the other by 13 US states. The companies \u2013 which range from a New York wine and spirits importer to a Virginia-based maker of educational kits and musical instruments \u2013 have said the tariffs will hurt their ability to do business. The lawsuit argued that the statue invoked by the president \u2013 the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) \u2013 does not give him the authority to unilaterally issue across-the-board worldwide tariffs. \u201cHis claimed emergency is a figment of his own imagination: trade deficits, which have persisted for decades without causing economic harm, are not an emergency. Nor do these trade deficits constitute an \u2018unusual and extraordinary threat\u2019,\u201d it argued. Court documents specifically cited thetariffs imposed on Australian territories where there are no people, and, hence, no commerce. \u201cThe Liberation Day Order imposed sweeping new tariffs at rates not seen since the Great Depression \u2013 including a global 10% tariffs on nearly all countries in the world \u2013 regardless of whether they impose tariffs on United States products, the rates at which they do so, or the existence of any trade agreements governing the relationship. \u201cThese tariffs even applied to places with no civilian population or international trade activity, such as [Australian territories] the Heard and McDonald Islands, which are inhabited only by penguins and seals.\u201d Australian financial analysts have warned that significant uncertainty remained around the ultimate fate of Trump\u2019s tariff regime. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst with Capital.com in Melbourne, said the court\u2019s ruling was massive news. \u201cIt\u2019s long been suggested that the emergency powers Trump has used to implement tariffs were unconstitutional and that the power to enact tariffs sits with Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sets up a battle that will likely end up in the supreme court now. It\u2019s a situation fraught with danger because the administration may ignore the court\u2019s ruling, potentially placing greater strain on US institutions at a time of increased stress.\u201d Sean Callow, a senior analyst at ITC Markets in Sydney, said while there must be significant caution over the ruling being overturned by higher courts, \u201cfor now the weight of money is being placed on the possibility that US courts prevent the White House from self-imposed economic damage, brightening US growth prospects and the US dollar\u201d. The White House and lawyers for groups that sued did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff and one of Trump\u2019s lead policy advisers, rebuked the court in a brief social media post, writing: \u201cThe judicial coup is out of control.\u201d At least five other legal challenges to the tariffs are pending. The attorney general of Oregon, Dan Rayfield, a Democrat whose office is leading the states\u2019 lawsuit, called Trump\u2019s tariffs unlawful, reckless and economically devastating. \u201cThis ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can\u2019t be made on the president\u2019s whim,\u201d Rayfield said in a statement. Under US law, tariffs must typically be approved by Congress. Trump has claimed broad authority to set tariffs under IEEPA, which is meant to address \u201cunusual and extraordinary\u201d threats during a national emergency. The law has historically been used to impose sanctions on enemies of the US or freeze their assets. Trump is the first US president to use it to impose tariffs.

Gallagher said environmental charities that mount legal challenges against big companies should have to disclose all of their financial backers. He was reflecting on the Munkara legal proceedings in the federal court that ended last year with the EDO ordered to pay Santos $9m in legal costs. EDO chief executive, David Morris, said: It comes as no surprise that the fossil fuel giants want to avoid legal scrutiny of their projects \u2026However, the public interest is not served by allowing these powerful vested interests to avoid the scrutiny and accountability that legal action provides. Community groups have a right to take legal action to ensure approval authorities and companies uphold the law. Indeed, many groups feel it is their duty to do so.\u201d Law groups calls for reform to whistleblower protections We reported earlier thatDavid McBride, a former military lawyer who leaked documents to the ABC, had lost an appeal to reduce his prison sentence. McBride was sentenced by the ACT supreme court last year to almost six years\u2019 imprisonment for leaking material later used by the ABC for an expos\u00e9 on alleged war crimes. His failed appeal has prompted theHuman Rights Law Centre, the Alliance for Journalists\u2019 Freedom and the Whistleblower Justice Fundto call on the Albanese Government to reform whistleblower protections. Kieran Pender, associate legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said: The truth should not be criminalised, yet Australia\u2019s broken whistleblower protection laws have led to numerous whistleblowers being prosecuted for speaking up. The Albanese government must act with urgent law reform and the establishment of a whistleblower protection authority, to ensure prosecutions like this never happen again. Whistleblowers should be protected, not punished.

Host Patricia Karvelas asked if the man\u2019s death warranted a renewed effort to investigate the number of deaths in custody. Burney said: I think it does need revisiting. The deaths continue, of course they\u2019re disproportionate, because there is a disproportionate amount of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in jail and juvenile justice.

The partyreunited with the Liberalstoday after a dramatic split. The ABC\u2019s Patricia Karvelas asked if the mending was superficial. McKenzie replied: \u201cNot at all.\u201d She added to the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing: Now the fact that the Liberal party has agreed to our policy positions, that\u2019s a good thing. We always believe our country is best served by a strong, stable, Liberal-National coalition, and so today\u2019s announcement of a shadow ministry includes both political parties I think is an important thing for us to get into the election review proper and start taking up to the Labor government.

He told ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing: I would make the case so we\u2019ve been strong in responding to climate change and we\u2019ve also been strong in using the law \u2026 in making this decision, relying on science Ed Husic has reiterated he believes it would be wise for Australia to impose targeted sanctions to oppose Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, \u201clooking at individuals who have been directing the operations\u201d in the region. He also said the government should be prepared for allies on the international stage to impose their own. Husic said on ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing: What I\u2019m trying to suggest is that we be prepared because if our friends and allies move on this, clearly the best option is to be a coordinated one. We need to use whatever mechanism we can to get the Israeli government \u2026 to recognise that its actions in enforcing this blockade is having a life or death impact on the most vulnerable.

NSW SES assistance commissioner Colin Malone said: We have teams on the ground and are working closely with recovery partners to provide support and assistance through a range of measures over the coming days. We are continuing to resupply isolated communities and we still have a few residual jobs to attend to, but with the assistance of our valued emergency service partners and community members mobilising to help we are working through them as quickly as possible. Anyone seeking flood recovery information can find thathere. Greens also unhappy with North West Shelf extension, will urge groups to take legal action The Greens say today\u2019s move has seen Labor fail its first climate test. The Greens leader, Larissa Waters, said in a statement: Sacrificing the oldest art gallery on the planet for Woodside\u2019s private profits while the Hunter has just experienced a 1-in-500 year flood event shows the climate madness this decision is. Approving fossil fuels out to 2070 totally undermines the government\u2019s commitment to net zero by 2050, which is already too late for a safe climate future. Waters said the Greens would encourage environmental groups to take legal action \u201cagainst this approval\u201d. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young called the extension an \u201cenvironmental disaster\u201d. The government has a choice this term \u2013 to work with the Greens in the Senate to insert a climate trigger into laws and ensure dirty projects are properly assessed for their impacts, or continue approving toxic coal and gas that sends our climate to collapse. Climate Council says Labor supporting \u2018massive climate bomb\u2019 with extension of gas facility The Climate Council has expressed deep disapproval after the Albanese government approved the extension of the contentious North West Shelf gas development until 2070. The group\u2019s CEO, Amanda McKenzie, said: Communities in NSW are starting the cleanup after record breaking floods. It is shocking that at the same time the Albanese government has approved this massive climate bomb as the first act of this term of government \u2026 If the government is actively making the climate crisis worse it must explain to communities, like those experiencing flooding right now, how it will protect them from more frequent and forceful extreme weather events. As reported earlier today, Unesco said such facilitiesshould be removed from the regionif Australia hopes to win world heritage listing for the area\u2019s 1 million rock carvings. Insurers have received more than 6,000 claims linked to the massive floods across NSW\u2019s mid-north coast, according to the Insurance Council of Australia \u2013 80% of those are linked to damage to homes. A hub to help process those claims has been set up at Taree Leagues Sports Centre and will run to 13 June. Andrew Hall, CEO of the council, said: It is confronting to see the extent of the damage across the region and it is clear the recovery is going to take some time and that means support must be ongoing. Insurers will continue to have a presence on the ground in impacted communities, and we urge anyone who needs help with their claim to come down to the hub and have a chat with the dedicated support staff. The group added it is too early to put a dollar figure on the total damage bill, but said it doesn\u2019t expect the number will be higher than the $6.4bn in losses incurred during the 2022 flooding. With that announcement wrapped up, I\u2019ll hand over toNick Visserto take you through the rest of the day\u2019s news. All the best. Sussan Leyhas said the culture of Parliament House must improve after SenatorFatima Paymanreported the behaviour of a male parliamentary colleague over claimed inappropriate comments. Ley said she was concerned by the news: I read that report with great concern and it is simply not good enough to have that behaviour take place in this building. It is vital that reporting of events like this are a reminder to everybody that we must never take our eye off the ball when it comes to continuous improvement in the culture in this building. Read the full report here: Littleproud denies demanding \u2018free for all\u2019 for shadow ministers David Littleproud has denied misleading his party room after Nationals MP Colin Boyce this morning accused his party leader of failing to raise a key issue believed to have motivated theCoalitionsplit. Liberal politicians said Littleproud had demanded shadow ministers be permitted to break shadow cabinet solidarity and cross the floor, which Nationals MPs said he had never discussed with them. Littleproud said he had never demanded a \u201cfree for all\u201d: It wasn\u2019t a demand, it was a conversation, and Sussan was quite clear that the parameters that we have were ones that we should continue to adhere to. I wasn\u2019t asking for a free for all and that was not something I think was appropriate to share \u2013 the fact that it\u2019s been ruminated out here \u2013 because I don\u2019t want a free for all in my party room. He said National party room members remained free to come forward and bring new policy or challenge existing policy. Disquiet among the Nationals MPs saw Barnaby Joyce endorse Michael McCormack to replace Littleproud as leader, but Littleproud denied McCormack was being punished for criticising him: I made it clear when I became leader three years ago that I wanted to have generational change but, at that point, wanted to respect the leadership that was before me to allow them to impart their wisdom. David Littleproud has refused to say whether he regretted his decision to split theCoalitionat a time Liberal leader Sussan Ley had left Canberra to be with her dying mother. Asked whether he had apologised to Ley for his decision, the Nationals leader said: With due respect, we made sure Sussan and I worked through that at a pace she was comfortable with \u2026 We were sensitive around that. So much so that \u2026 Sussan offered to fly back to Canberra to have our first meeting and I made it clear I didn\u2019t want her to leave her mother\u2019s side.",

        "raw_text": "Organisers ofEdinburghfringe events have been urged to be \u201cpretty smart\u201d and capitalise on the decision by Oasis and AC/DC to play gigs in the city midway through the festival. There was surprise and irritation when it emerged the bands would be staging four concerts at Murrayfield stadium in mid-August when the world\u2019s largest arts festival is in full flow. Tony Lankester, who recently took over as the Fringe Society\u2019s chief executive, said fringe companies should see the concerts as an opportunity rather than fret about downsides. About 75,000 fans are expected for each concert \u2013 three by Oasis and one by AC/DC, putting the city\u2019s trains, buses and trams under even greater strain, with visitors competing for alreadyscarce and expensive hotel beds. Lankester, who previously ran South Africa\u2019s national arts festival, said fringe venues should tempt Edinburgh residents who may \u201cwant to hide\u201d when the concerts take place with discounted tickets or free wine. Venues could also tempt Oasis andAC/DCconcertgoers with \u201cmorning after\u201d performances in the city with free bacon rolls and coffee, he suggested. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to happen is for the local audience to hide that night,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some pretty smart marketing type things that I think venues could be looking at. The fact is that it\u2019s not going away. Why not be completely opportunistic about it?\u201d This year\u2019s fringe, which runs from 1 to 25 Augustand takes place alongside the international festival and book festival, is expected to involve about 50,000 performances at 265 venues. Lankester said the strength of the programme, which includes themes such as rebellious women, the apocalypse, queer joy and rave culture, showed artists were as hungry as ever to perform despite global crises and tensions. \u201cWhat excites me most about the programme, is the signal that it sends is of an industry in healthy shape,\u201d he said. For the first time, five shows from US performers are being underwritten by donors to theKeep it Fringefunding strand launched in 2023 by the Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the fringe\u2019s honorary president, to support new, marginalised or innovative acts. Lankester said he had numerous conversations that \u201creaffirmed for me what I knew coming into this job, that there\u2019s a lot of love and joy around the fringe. It\u2019s something that people absolutely want to preserve, protect, engage with, be part of. It\u2019s still on an incredible number of people\u2019s bucket lists.\u201d He said he was talking to major brands about the potential to become headline sponsors of the fringe for the first time, to bring in extra revenue for performers and venues at a time of intense pressure on public funding. He said those discussions were at an early stage, but indicated it could involve a bank or beer brand. No sponsor would be allowed to rebrand the fringe, but their investments would help the festival to improve its finances. Sign up toThe Guide Get our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every Friday after newsletter promotion In her last newspaper interview, Shona McCarthy, Lankester\u2019s immediate predecessor,accused political leaders of consistently neglecting the fringeand failing to adequately invest in services, transport and infrastructure such as mobile phone services. Lankester said he \u201cstood by\u201d everything McCarthy had said. Her \u201cenormously valuable\u201d intervention had fuelled action and more responsiveness in the council, the Scottish government and other agencies, he said, adding: \u201cThe message landed.\u201d Lankester is lobbying Edinburgh council to devote at least \u00a31.1m of a new visitor levy on hotel beds to supporting the festival, and is in talks about strengthening the city\u2019s ailing mobile and wifi services, as well as improved rail services for non-residents. The visitor levy will come into force in July 2026, but hotels will begin collecting it on all bookings made from October this year. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to happen is for that money to sort of disappear into a black hole and for no benefit to be felt by the people [who] drive a big chunk of that revenue,\u201d he said.",

        "raw_text": "It does not take long for a crowd to gather when the Jail Time Records van pulls up to the kerb and starts blasting music in Cameroon\u2019s port city, Douala. Set up not just to play music but as a mobile recording studio, too, the van passes through the city\u2019s poorer neighbourhoods, offering the microphone to Douala\u2019s aspiring but unguided young musicians. The goal is to scout for new talent while also helping out young people in areas plagued by drugs and crime. \u201cWe go to the ghettos with the mobile recording studio, start blasting the music and open the mic up for freestylers. More and more young people start gathering and freestyling. They want to be part of it,\u201d says Steve Happi, co-founder of Jail Time Records \u2013a label that started in Cameroon\u2019s prisons. Since 2019, Jail Time Records has been operating in Cameroon\u2019s toughest prison, helping inmates to find a creative outlet and even launch a career in music. The project\u2019s success has meant the authorities in Burkina Faso are also allowing the label to operate a music project from Ouagadougou\u2019s prison there but the team wanted to expand what they do in Cameroon by reaching some young people before they end up in prison. Happi says: \u201cThe reality is the only older brother figures they have to look up to from the ghetto are mostly the drug dealers, so they are growing up in the hands of criminals. Our goal with this project is to put up a hand and say we can go in another direction too.\u201d Many of the young people disappear down the backstreets soon after their freestyling, never seen by Happi again, but occasionally they come across a talent that they can bring back to the studio. In time, they hope to release an album of songs from the street sessions. Happi\u2019s task is not easy \u2013 some of the young people are difficult to track down because they do not have phones or they have sold them because they need money. He is also tussling for influence with the negative forces in the city, especially the phenomenon of\u201cmicrobes\u201d \u2013 gangs of dozens of youthswho often mob parts of the city, attacking people and stealing. It is an issue that has got worse with the rising influence of drugs and gangs in Douala, he says. Sign up toGlobal Dispatch Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team after newsletter promotion But for young people such as one 21-year-old who records under the name Diblaq, this is the opportunity they have been waiting for. \u201cThe street freestyles allowed me to develop my music in a new way. My environment isn\u2019t really favourable to my growth but I used to struggle to save up some money and then head straight to the studio,\u201d says Diblaq. \u201cNow, with Jail Time Records, I have access to a recording studio for free. Creating music gives me a certain freedom, allows me to express myself and share my feelings with those around me.\u201d Happi knows there is talent in the neglected corners of Douala but that when recording costs are too much for most, talented young people can have their lives derailed by small mistakes, such as drug possession, which can lead to harsh prison sentences. It is in jail that many pick up far worse habits. The aim of the project is to start helping young people at every stage, by giving them guidance and hope before they end up in jail, in addition to the work they were doing with those already in prison and those who have been released. That work has helped people such as KMB, who came across Jail Time Records when imprisoned as a child but now, aged 21 and out of jail, is trying to use music to steer clear of prison. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult in this environment to find work and stay out of trouble because I grew up in a poor area and have been involved in criminal activities,\u201d says KMB. \u201cThe project helps me to record my music and pursue my passion and avoid going back to my old demons.\u201d",

        "raw_text": "I\u2019d just left Suede and was living in a basement flat in Highgate, London, making music in my tiny box room. It was a lonely time, but a lovely summer and I decided to do something uplifting and joyous. There were a bunch of records I loved listening to on a sunny day \u2013 Dusty Springfield\u2019s I Only Want to Be With You, The First Picture of You by the Lotus Eaters, You on My Mind by Swing Out Sister, which has Bacharach key changes and strings. I wanted to make a piece of music that gave me the buzz those songs did. I didn\u2019t want to worry about an album or sleeve artwork or how the video was going to go. I just wanted people to hear the song and feel like the sun had come out. I needed strings for the demo and found a fellow who was advertising samples in Loot magazine \u2013 this was 1994, before you could get anything you needed on your laptop. I remember going round to his flat and waiting for hours while he copied them on to a floppy disc. There was never a plan to sing the song myself. I\u2019d been writing with Julianne Regan, who was in All About Eve, so she was the first person to have a crack at writing a melody and lyrics. After she went her own way, Geoff Travis at Rough Trade played the demo to Morrissey, who asked for a meeting \u2013 we ended up playing pinball. A week later, I got a letter from him that just said: \u201cDear Bernard, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t.\u201d Then I spent an afternoon with Kirsty MacColl, who really loved what I\u2019d done but still wanted to change everything. Someone suggested I go and see David McAlmont playing at the Jazz Cafe. During his first song, the drummer Makoto Sakamoto came on and started smashing the shit out of his drums \u2013 it was the greatest sound I\u2019d ever heard. Then David started singing and I was like, \u201cWell, there it is.\u201d I knew I needed both of them. I gave David a tape of the instrumental and two days later he came round to my flat with what he\u2019d written. He only had words for one verse. I said: \u201cJust sing it twice. We\u2019ll worry about that later.\u201d But we never got around to it and people don\u2019t seem to notice. I love the message of the lyric: it\u2019s a big \u201cfuck you\u201d, but delivered in the most positive way. We recorded the strings then spent a couple of days in producer Mike Hedges\u2019 chateau in Normandy. We set the drums up in the old stone cellar \u2013 Mako didn\u2019t speak English but I directed him with my arms and remember the room shaking as he produced that eruption you hear at the start of the record. David recorded his vocals in the ballroom \u2013 he seemed to find the key-change leap effortless. I was standing 10ft away thinking: \u201cThis is going to be great.\u201d Yes is my favourite out of all the records I\u2019ve ever made. To make a song that people put on to feel good is just magic. Years after it came out, I was at a fireworks display with my kids. They always finished the night with a banger. That year, they closed with Yes. That just blew my mind. Knowing three artists before me had been given the option to do something with this great piece of music was very motivating. Bernard had evoked Motown, Burt Bacharach and Dusty Springfield, but he\u2019d added a rocky thing. I wanted to try something simple. Initially, I came up with something quite T Rex but my flatmate said: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit one dimensional, dear.\u201d I remember sticking my finger into my vinyl pile, touching the soundtrack to Judy Garland\u2019s version of A Star Is Born, and thinking: \u201cWhat would Judy do?\u201d Lyrically, it was such a punt. I\u2019d been dating somebody who I really liked, but he\u2019d just kind of ghosted me. I was thinking: \u201cWhat would I say to him if I became famous?\u201d I just started singing: \u201cSo you want to know me now?\u201d It was delusional, really. Before Yes came out, a friend asked me: \u201cWhat kind of a song is it?\u201d I said: \u201cIt\u2019s an I Will Survive for the 90s.\u201d I remember getting to the climactic point after the second chorus where the song builds and builds and I sing: \u201cI\u2019m better, better, Ye-e-e-e-es!\u201d I was thinking I was done, but then Bernard said: \u201cWe need something for the end, a kind of refrain.\u201d I thought: \u201cSmokey Robinson!\u201d And I used my falsetto to repeat: \u201cI feel well enough to tell you what you can do with what you got.\u201d The recording actually uses varispeed to pitch that part a semitone out of my comfort zone, so I was much happier performing the song with a live band onLater With Jools Hollandthan I was singing along to the backing track on Top of the Pops. Over the years, I\u2019ve met women who have told me they left abusive relationships thanks to Yes. After our second Top of the Pops appearance, the sister of the show\u2019s producer came over to say she\u2019d been unable to walk and the song had helped her to get up. It has a power I can\u2019t account for. After it had reached the Top 10, I went to see Jimmy Somerville live \u2013 and the guy who inspired the lyric was there. He said: \u201cOh my god, David, you\u2019re doing so well!\u201d I was standing there biting my lip, thinking: \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d Butler, Blake & Grant play Cambridge Junction on 6 June before touring the UK.

It was frequently noted that, besides the Manic Street Preachers\u2019 A Design for Life, Common People was the only significant hit of theBritpopyears that might be described as a protest song, a bulwark against the accusation that the era had nothing more substantial to offer than flag-waving and faux-gorblimey. At a time when ostensibly \u201calternative\u201d rock bands had seemed suddenly desperate for mainstream acceptance, Pulp had become huge by sticking up for outsiders and weirdos. Mis-Shapes, for example, hymned the kinds of people one suspected some of Oasis\u2019s fans would have happily thumped. They had also been quick to call time on rock\u2019s disastrous association with New Labour, releasing the scathing Cocaine Socialism a year after Tony Blair was elected. If there weren\u2019t a huge number of takers for Cocker\u2019s musical solo projects, his national treasure status seemed to grow and grow. Pulp reformed in 2011 to general rejoicing, and again in 2022, by which point they could reasonably claim to be the only major Britpop band exerting an obvious influence on current artists (clearlySports Teamand, latterly, Welly both have Pulp in their DNA) and note that their infamous flop greatest hits collection had finally gone platinum. But there\u2019s a huge difference between playing the old favourites live and making a new album. If you don\u2019t want to sully your catalogue with a photocopy of past glories, you\u2019d better have something new to say, something the oddly equivocal tone of Spike Island and indeed the Cocker quote accompanying More \u2013 \u201cthis is the best we can do\u201d \u2013 seems to acknowledge. In fact, like Blur on last year\u2019s acclaimedThe Ballad of Darren, Pulp have found a way to successfully apply their longstanding approach to a very different stage of life when, as Cocker puts it on Slow Jam, \u201cyou\u2019ve gone from all you that could be to all that you once were\u201d. A man who once fantasised about cuckoldry as an act of class rage-fuelled revenge now finds himself addressing how divorce impacts on your potential to find love again on Background Noise (in a characteristic touch, this existential meditation takes place in the middle of a shopping centre). Tina effectively transposes the kind ofPulpsong that ruminates on missed romantic opportunities \u2013 Babies, Disco 2000, Inside Susan \u2013 into middle-age, the frustration sharpened by the fact that it\u2019s 40 years since that particular opportunity sailed. Similarly, Cocker was always exceptionally skilled at drawing confused, youthful relationships and at making capital from the grubby mundane aspects of sex. He still is, although on Grown Ups, the relationship is depicted as taking place on a planet now out of reach, \u201cbecause the rocket doesn\u2019t have enough fuel\u201d to get back \u2013 to youth, presumably \u2013 and on My Sex, all the grubby mundanity has taken on a pressing tone as libido dims: \u201cHurry \u2019cos with sex, we\u2019re running out of time.\u201d Given how strong the imprint of their frontman\u2019s voice is, it seems almost pointless to note that the contents of More sound like Pulp \u2013 if Cocker was unexpectedly recruited as lead singer of Cannibal Corpse, they\u2019d probably sound like Pulp too \u2013 but suffice to say the music here does all the things a longstanding fan might expect. There are melodies derived from Gallic chanson, tinny electronics, rhythms that lean towards disco, sprechgesang verses that build into anthemic choruses and a lot of flourishes that recall 70s pop (there\u2019s also a surprising amount of violin redolent of long-departed member Russell Senior). More importantly, it does these things really well: the epic A Hymn of the North is as heart-rending a Scott Walker-influenced ballad as Pulp have ever recorded, while if they had released the joyous Got to Have Love as their post-Different Class comeback single in 1998, rather than Help the Aged, their commercial fortunes might have taken a different shape. More certainly isn\u2019t going to convince anyone who doesn\u2019t already like Pulp to change their mind, but then anyone who expects a reformed band\u2019s first album in nearly 25 years to do that is perhaps grappling with wildly unreasonable expectations. It\u2019s more likely that a reformed band\u2019s new album might be a placeholder, filled with songs that pad out the hits live, but provoke a rush on the bars and loos in the process. That definitely isn\u2019t the case with More. If this is the best Pulp can do, it\u2019s more than good enough.",

        "raw_text": "James Lowe, the singer of psychedelic rock band the Electric Prunes, has died aged 82. His family said in a statement that he died of natural causes. \u201cDad leaves behind a legacy of sound, love and boundless creativity,\u201d they said on Facebook. \u201cAt the centre of it all was our amazing mom, Pamela \u2013 his guiding star, enduring muse and wife of 62 years. We know how deeply he cherished this community, and we feel that love too.\u201d Formed in Los Angeles in 1965, the band\u2019s second single, 1966\u2019s I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night), reached No 11 in the US, and proved their biggest hit. (Most of their hits were written by Annette Tucker and Nancie Mantz.) More significant, perhaps, was the song\u2019s inclusion on the 1972 psych and garage compilation Nuggets, a cult favourite for more than 50 years, and their general influence over the emerging psychedelic scene. Lowe said that the band wanted to make \u201cfree-form garage music\u201d. The band\u2019s name started as a joke and they had a short-lived, tumultuous existence, with Lowe later admitting that they were learning to play their instruments as they went along, with one significant early woodshedding session taking place at the house of Leon Russell. Members came and went, a David Axelrod-produced album of psychedelic pop and Gregorian music flopped and inspired a disastrous live performance, and producer and engineer Dave Hassinger\u2019s rights to the name allowed him to reassemble the band at will. Lowe left in 1968. The so-called New Improved Electric Prunes released their last album, Just Good Old Rock and Roll, in 1969 and split a year later. Lowe distanced himself from the band until interest resurged in the 1990s and he began touring and recording with other members of the group. The song Kyrie Eleison, from the Gregorian-inspired album Mass in F Minor, had been used in the 1969 film Easy Rider and part of the album were later sampled by the likes of MF Doom and Madlib. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving original member. Lowe was born in San Luis Obispo, California, on 5 March 1943 and lived in Hawaii for a time as a teenager. When he returned to California, he performed folk music and worked in rocket engine production before forming the Sanctions, the band that evolved into the Electric Prunes. After the band\u2019s split, Lowe worked as a recording engineer, contributing to significant works such as all three albums by Todd Rundgren\u2019s band Nazz and the first album by the band that would become Sparks, then known as Halfnelson. That record flopped, prompting Lowe to leave music to work in television production. In 2000,he told US author Richie Unterbergerthat the band\u2019s reunion had reminded him \u201chow much fun music is. Take away the profit motive and all that greed and you get back to trying to make a good record \u2026 it\u2019s very hard.\u201d Of the Electric Prunes\u2019 brief existence, he said: \u201cSome things are meant to be short and sweet. Life is but a dream.\u201d This article was amended on 2 June 2025. Lowe is pictured centre in the group photograph, not second right as previously stated.",

        "raw_text": "Fifty years ago, Cabaret Voltaire shocked the people ofSheffieldinto revolt. A promoter screamed for the band to get off stage, while an audience baying for blood had to be held back with a clarinet being swung around for protection. All of which was taking place over the deafening recording of a looped steamhammer being used in place of a drummer, as a cacophony of strange, furious noises drove the crowd into a frenzy. \u201cWe turned up, made a complete racket, and then got attacked,\u201d recalls Stephen Mallinder. \u201cYes, there was a bit of a riot, and I ended up in hospital, but it was great. That gig was the start of something because nothing like that had taken place in Sheffield before. It was ground zero.\u201d Mallinder and his Cabaret Voltaire co-founder Chris Watson are sitting together again in Sheffield, looking back on that lift-off moment ahead of a handful of shows to commemorate the milestone. \u201cIt is astonishing,\u201d says Watson. \u201cHalf a century. It really makes you stop, think and realise the significance.\u201d Thedeath in 2021 of third founding member Richard H Kirkwas a trigger for thinking about ending things with finality. \u201cIt\u2019ll be nice if we can use these shows to remind people what we did,\u201d says Mallinder. \u201cTo acknowledge the music, as well as get closure.\u201d It\u2019s impossible to overstate how ahead of their time \u201cthe Cabs\u201d were. Regularly crowned the godfathers of the Sheffield scene, inspiring a wave of late 1970s groups such as the Human League and Clock DVA, they were making music in Watson\u2019s attic as early as 1973. Their primitive explorations with tape loops, heavily treated vocals and instruments, along with home-built oscillators and synthesisers, laid the foundations for a singular career that would span experimental music, post-punk, industrial funk, electro, house and techno. \u201cThere was nothing happening in Sheffield that we could relate to,\u201d says Mallinder. \u201cWe had nothing to conform to. We didn\u2019t give a fuck. We just enjoyed annoying people, to be honest.\u201d Inspired by dadaism, they would set up speakers in cafes and public toilets, or strap them to a van and drive around Sheffield blasting out their groaning, hissing and droning in an attempt to spook and confuse people. \u201cIt did feel a bit violent and hostile at times, but more than anything we just ruined people\u2019s nights,\u201d laughs Mallinder, with Watson recalling a memory from their very first gig: \u201cThe organiser said to me after, \u2018You\u2019ve completely ruined our reputation.\u2019 That was the best news we could have hoped for.\u201d Insular and incendiary, the tight-knit trio had their own language, says Mallinder. \u201cWe talked in a cipher only we understood \u2013 we had our own jargon and syntax.\u201d When I interviewed Kirk years before his death, he went even further. \u201cWe were like a terrorist cell,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t ended up doing music and the arts, we might have ended up going around blowing up buildings as frustrated people wanting to express their disgust at society.\u201d Instead they channelled that disgust into a type of sonic warfare \u2013 be it the blistering noise and head-butt attack of their landmark electro-punk track Nag Nag Nag, or the haunting yet celestial Red Mecca, an album rooted in political tensions and religious fundamentalism that throbs with a paranoid pulse. Watson left the group in 1981 to pursue a career in sound recording for TV. Mallinder and Kirk invested in technology, moving away from the industrial sci-fi clangs of their early period into grinding yet glistening electro-funk. As the second summer of love blazed in the UK in 1988, they headed to Chicago instead \u2013 to make Groovy, Laidback and Nasty with house legend Marshall Jefferson. \u201cWe got slagged off for working with Marshall,\u201d recalls Mallinder. \u201cPeople were going, \u2018England has got its own dance scene. Why aren\u2019t you working with Paul Oakenfold?\u2019 But we\u2019re not the fucking Happy Mondays. We\u2019d already been doing that shit for years. We wanted to acknowledge our connection to where we\u2019d come from: Black American music.\u201d This major label era for the group produced moderate commercial success before they wound things down in the mid-1990s. But in the years since, everyone from New Order to Trent Reznor has cited the group\u2019s influence. Mallinder continued to make electronic music via groups such as Wrangler and Creep Show, the latter in collaboration with John Grant, a Cabs uber-fan. Watson says leaving the group was \u201cprobably the most difficult decision I\u2019ve ever made\u201d but he has gone on to have an illustrious career, winning Baftas for his recording work with David Attenborough on shows such as Frozen Planet. He recalls \u201cthe most dangerous journey I\u2019ve ever made\u201d being flown in a dinky helicopter that was akin to a \u201cwashing machine with a rotor blade\u201d by drunk Russian pilots in order to reach a camp on the north pole. On 2003 album Weather Report, Watson harnessed his globetrotting field recording adventures with stunning effect, turning long, hot wildlife recording sessions in Kenya surrounded by buzzing mosquitoes, or the intense booming cracks of colossal glaciers in Iceland, into a work of immersive musical beauty. When he was at the Ignalina nuclear power plant in Lithuania with Oscar-winning composer Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir, recording sounds for the score to the 2019 TV series Chernobyl, he couldn\u2019t help but draw parallels to his Cabs days. \u201cIt was horrific but really astonishing \u2013 such a tense, volatile, hostile environment,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it really got me thinking about working with those sounds again, their musicality and how it goes back to where I started.\u201d Sign up toSleeve Notes Get music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras. Every genre, every era, every week after newsletter promotion Mallinder views Watson\u2019s work as a Trojan horse for carrying radical sounds into ordinary households. \u201cThe Cabs may have changed people\u2019s lives but Chris is personally responsible for how millions of people listen to the world,\u201d he says, with clear pride. \u201cAnd one of the things that helped make that happen was the fact that he was in the Cabs, so through that lens he opened up people\u2019s ears.\u201d Watson agrees, saying Cabaret Voltaire \u201cinformed everything I\u2019ve ever done\u201d. Watson\u2019s field recordings will play a part in the upcoming shows: he\u2019ll rework 2013 project Inside the Circle of Fire, in which he recorded Sheffield itself, from its wildlife to its steel industry via football terraces and sewers. \u201cIt\u2019s hopefully not the cliched industrial sounds of Sheffield,\u201d he says, \u201cbut my take on the signature sounds of the city.\u201d These will be interwoven with a set Mallinder is working on with his Wrangler bandmate Ben \u201cBenge\u201d Edwards as well as longtime friend and Cabs collaborator Eric Random. \u201cWe\u2019ve built 16 tracks up from scratch to play live,\u201d says Mallinder. \u201cWith material spanning from the first EP\u201d \u2013 1978\u2019s Extended Play \u2013 \u201cthrough to Groovy \u2026\u201d Mallinder says this process has been \u201ca bit traumatic \u2013 a very intense period of being immersed in my past and the memories that it brought, particularly of Richard. This isn\u2019t something you can do without emotion.\u201d Mallinder and Kirk were not really speaking in the years leading up to his death, with Kirk operating under the Cabaret Voltaire name himself. \u201cRichard was withdrawn and didn\u2019t speak to many people,\u201d says Mallinder. \u201cAnd I was one of those people. He wanted to be in his own world. It was difficult because I missed him and there was a lot of history, but I accepted it.\u201d There will be no new music being made as Cabaret Voltaire because, they stress, tsuch a thing cannot exist without Kirk. Instead, it\u2019s a brief victory lap for the pair, a tribute to their late friend, as they sign off on a pioneering legacy with maybe one last chance for a riot. \u201cRichard would probably hate us doing this but it\u2019s done with massive respect,\u201d Mallinder says. \u201cI\u2019m sad he\u2019s not here but there\u2019s such love for the Cabs that I want to give people the opportunity to acknowledge what we did. You can\u2019t deny the music we made is important \u2013 and this is a way to celebrate that.\u201d Cabaret Voltaire play a Forge Warehouse, Sheffield, 25 October, then tour the UK from 17 to 21 November.

They\u2019re from Mildura and they\u2019re getting sweeter.\u201dAt $3 a kilo in supermarkets, they\u2019re closely followed by mandarins. Daisy, imperial and Premium Gem varieties are also at their peak. \u201cA Premium Gem mandarin is a new one in our shop,\u201d says Flamminio. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the perfect amount of tang, with a few seeds. They\u2019re a rounded, symmetrical mandarin.\u201d At Melbourne\u2019s Happy Apple, senior buyer Graham Gee has his eye on Cara Cara oranges, which will arrive this month. They\u2019re seedless and known for their sweet flavour. Grapefruits are in season too, and can be found for about $5 a kilo in supermarkets. Berries, however, have faltered. \u201cBlueberries are quite diabolical at the moment. They\u2019re in really short supply,\u201d says Gee. \u201cThey are out of season and affected by the weather. You\u2019re looking at double-figure price tags for anything that is half decent, which is tough.\u201d Blueberries are expected to fall in price in another three to four weeks, but it\u2019s not all blue. In Queensland, strawberries and raspberries are kicking off, with strawberries soon to come down to $2 or $3 a punnet. But the best crop to make a comeback is Hass avocados. \u201cYou\u2019ll see some for a couple of dollars apiece, great multi-buy deals, and the quality is really good. We\u2019ve got such an appetite for them,\u201d says Gee. At a couple of dollars a bunch, depending on size and quality, Flamminio says there is plenty of cavolo nero, silverbeet, kale and cabbage and all unaffected by the rain. \u201cPeople are doing lots of soups and stews and bakes. They\u2019re very affordable and wintry. Silverbeet is humongous. They\u2019re almost a metre long, and gorgeous.\u201d We all know silverbeet can wilt down to nothing, but it is front and centre in a Yotam Ottolenghi southIndian and Sri Lankan inspired stir-fry, or you can stuff theenormous leaves with rice, herbs and spices.Pumpkins are in their prime, at $2 a kilo or less in grocers and supermarkets. \u201cThey\u2019re not green any more, they\u2019re sun-kissed and bright orange,\u201d says Flamminio. Butternut, Jap or Queensland blue pumpkin are all available, says Gee. Sweet potatoes and potatoes are also filling shelves, at $3.50 to $4.50 a kilo, respectively. We can expect to see reasonable prices throughout the rest of winter. Make use of citrus and the best orange-coloured veg in Alice Zaslavsky\u2019s one-trayroast pumpkin, sweet potato and carrot soup. Brussels sprouts are also budding, but haven\u2019t quite reached their cheapest. Flamminio says they can be as low as $3.99 a kilo at their peak. He recommends rhubarb too. The crops are a rich red, with thick stalks \u2013 perfect for dessert. Ravneet Gill has apicture-perfect tartthat shows off the pink, plus a twist onrhubarb and custard with tapioca. Or you can go back to basics and spruce up a bowl of porridge withNigel Slater\u2019s rhubarb addition. After cold weather and the cyclone damage, tomatoes are not looking rosy. \u201cThis is the worst I\u2019ve seen in four years,\u201d says Flamminio, . \u201cI\u2019ve got them for $10.99 a kilo in my shop because I can\u2019t justify asking people to pay $14.99. People could be charging $16 to $18 a kilo to make a margin. For the next three or four weeks, hold on to your hat for tomatoes.\u201d Cucumbers are more expensive, even compared with three or four weeks ago, and grocers are still waiting for red capsicums to kick in within the month, after rain in Queensland slowed supply.

It has slightly lengthened my walking commute, while significantly shortening my time on mass transit. And yet, every morning, I am faced with frustration. People crowd the entryways, making it difficult to shuffle deeper into the aisles. On packed carriages, we fail to file to the sides, forcing fellow riders to fight their way to the doors upon departure. These breaches of etiquette would earn you filthy looks in London or Paris, and verbal chastisement in New York. In Singapore, frustrated passengers could simply point to a sign above their heads, telling commuters what not to do. While no city has solved the problem of manspreading, in Sydney we contend with bag spreading too. Passengers dump their belongings on the seats beside them, even when others are standing. Worse still, I\u2019ve seen bags sprawled across the floor. This trip hazard would be warned against any in OH&S handbook. Why should our ride to work be any different? I hear from colleagues in Melbourne that trams are plagued by this issue too. This all gives me a major case of cultural cringe, because bag spreading isn\u2019t a problem for our international visitors. I love to hear other languages spoken on the metro, but I love to see backpacks placed on laps and suitcases tucked between legs even more. I appreciate that not every passenger is lucky enough to have experienced commutes in other countries. So patronising as it may be, I want our expanding public infrastructure to come with an education campaign. A few Singapore-style signs would not go astray.

        "raw_text": "Daniel and I went to the same high school in Melbourne. He was a year older than me, and we must have passed each other thousands of times, but I have no memory of ever talking to him. We knew of each other, but we didn\u2019t know each other\u2019s names. We met properly for the first time at a pre-drinks when I was in my first year of university. He was holding a six-pack of beer and looked vaguely familiar. I introduced myself, he offered me one of his drinks and we got talking. Not long after, we started dating. We\u2019d walk on the beach in St Kildatogether, cook meals and grab coffee whenever we could. It was simple, easy and just felt right. I quickly realised Daniel and I could dive deep into a shared passion of ours \u2013 Australian politics \u2013 without it ever turning into a fight. At the time, I was studying politics as part of my arts/law degree, and Daniel had been a member of the Labor party since he was 16. In Daniel, I found someone who spoke the same language and shared similar values. Politics wasn\u2019t the sole foundation of our relationship, but when something big happened, we weren\u2019t shy about debating it. While we were still at university, Daniel landed a job working for a politician. I decided to copy him, and I emailed every member of parliament in Victoria until one of them offered me a role. If he could do it, so could I. We pushed each other forward like that, and we still do. When Daniel decided to run for federal parliament at just 21, I campaigned with him every step of the way. We door-knocked together and handed out his flyers. People would do a double take when they met him, looking at his scuffed Converse sneakers. He ran in a safe Liberal seat, against a candidate who later became Australia\u2019s trade minister. Slim chances didn\u2019t bother Daniel, though. He ran for office because he had the time and believed in the cause. I remember being so proud of him for trying his best, even in the face of great odds. The night of the election, we hung out and watched the results roll in live on TV. Daniel was exhausted after handing out how-to-vote cards all day, and we both knew he\u2019d lost. Despite that, he still had a big smile on his face, and in that moment, I knew this was my guy. I felt so moved watching how much Daniel gave of himself \u2013 not for praise, but because he truly cared. It was one of those quiet, powerful moments. When I ran for parliament, years later, Daniel returned the favour. He hung my posters around our neighbourhood and helped me letterbox. When the votes were counted and I didn\u2019t win, he knew exactly what to say, because he\u2019d been there too. We\u2019ve been married for a decade now and have five kids together. Despite the chaos of our busy life, Daniel and I regularly have animated discussions about what\u2019s going on in the country. Our garage is still a jumble of old campaign signs wedged between prams and half-empty tins of paint. The kids sometimes drag one out, asking if we really did run for parliament and if we won. We laugh, because that was never the point. For us, politics is about trying to make Australia a better place. These days, we\u2019re more likely to be caring for our children than campaigning, but the ideas that motivated us back then still drive us. We did it for the children we were dreaming of, and now we\u2019re raising them. Do you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

        "raw_text": "On our very first night in the bush, Gordon Dedman issued a warning: \u201cFussy people die.\u201d Dedman, a man with an apt name for a military survival instructor, is all muscle and green khaki. Sat by the fire, he addresses his students. \u201cThis is not a wellness retreat. It is about getting out of your comfort zone.\u201d I am in the Camden bush, on Dharawal and Gundungurra Country, for a four-day wilderness survival course taught by the consultant forTV\u2019s most gruelling show, Alone Australia. On the itinerary: knife work, knots, emergency shelters, fire lighting, water collection, plant identification, solar and celestial navigation, plus emergency signalling and rescue techniques. On my person: fresh hiking boots, gold hoops, perfectly low-rise cargo pants and a black tee. The last time I went camping was with school in year 9, in a tent set up about 50 steps from a cabin. Out of my comfort zone, indeed \u2013 this time I don\u2019t have a tent, or a toilet. After a short hike, we arrive at sunset to a large green tarp billowing gently. It\u2019s a military parachute, Dedman tells us. We gather at a semicircle of stools beneath the canopy. Dedman gets straight to it. The goal of \u201csurvival\u201d is to be found, he says. This isdifferent to bushcraft, which has a direct relationship with nature and draws from the skills traditional cultures used to live in the wilderness. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Dedman\u2019s philosophy about the land and people\u2019s role on it is clear just a few hours in: \u201cOur existence here is based on the caring capacity of the Earth. \u201cBut we live in a system of expanding expenditure \u2026 at total odds with nature. Something is very broken with our system.\u201d We go around the circle of 15 students, introducing ourselves. Most of us are novices, mainly Sydney and Canberra-based men with office jobs looking to reconnect with the outdoors (participant Julian Carrick says he is here to \u201csoothe the soul\u201d and \u201csee the stars\u201d) plus two parents, their eager sons and myself. Some students have dabbled in survival and bushcraft for years \u2013 including Karla Pound, a National Geographic expedition leader and contestant on the current season of Alone. We\u2019re not equipped for when things go wrong, she tells me. She says even during common occurrences such as power outages and floods, \u201cpeople don\u2019t know the first thing to do\u201d. \u201cIt is really important to have these basic, fundamental skills under your belt.\u201d The parachute tarp becomes our base for the next four days, with classes held early in the morning and late at night. These hours are by design, to simulate the exhaustion and distraction one might feel in a real survival situation. Meanwhile our days are structured around practical skills. First, knives (I\u2019m limp-wristed and slow), then knots (I actually catch on). We use both to set up our first emergency shelters \u2013 pitched plastic sheets strung up between two trees and secured with pegs we carved ourselves, totally open to the surrounds. These structures are called hootchies. I am slow to find a spot \u2013 too picky, terrified of sleeping near thick shrubbery. It\u2019s a justified fear, I\u2019d say, given we are in the habitat of funnel web spiders, king brown and red belly black snakes. By the time I choose a location, the sun is setting. I fumble in the dark, trying to hold all my ropes and pegs in place. It is only thanks to kind peers \u2013 a physio and a former-detective-turned-teacher \u2013 that I am able to set up in time for dinner. \u201cThe western world has a problem with food aversion,\u201d Dedman says at meal time. So true. I\u2019m hungry for the potato cooking under the bonfire coals we are sitting around. We waste so much, he says, we\u2019re disconnected from our food\u2019s sources. I nod when he mentions more sustainable protein alternatives to beef. Then he brings out a container of live meal worms. We are going to eat them, he says. I laugh. Classic Dedman! My head torch lights up the plump, yellow bodies writhing in the container and visceral anxiety floods my stomach. \u201cFussy people die.\u201dAfter several failed attempts, I get the worms into my mouth. They wriggle around my fingers. They thrash against my lips. They burst between my teeth, and the group applauds. I actually enjoy the taste. This will forever be my greatest feat. I am overcome with relief! But Dedman has leftovers. I was too hesitant, he tells me. I can will myself to do anything, he says. Eat more. I manage to eat a second squirming helping and then Dedman lets me be. Our next course: crickets. Sign up toSaved for Later Catch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tips after newsletter promotion We are shown how to take one in our hands, efficiently break off its head, slide the body on to a stick and roast it over the fire. My throat is closing up at this point. The insects are jumping. My hands are shaking. A course instructor suggests I try breathing. \u201cIt\u2019s twitching in the fire!\u201d the 12-year-old observes. I realise if I\u2019m actually caught out in the bush I\u2019ll likely perish because I can\u2019t catch, behead and eat a cricket. An instructor does it for me. Ever since being attacked by a swarm of seagulls on a beach, I\u2019ve been a little jumpy around animals. I start overthinking my impending night\u2019s sleep \u2013 what if I wake up to a snake in my sleeping bag? But on a midnight walk to learn celestial navigation before bed, my thoughts are interrupted when we turn off our torches and look up. The air is crisp, the surrounds are silent and the sky glimmers. Fear is replaced by cool, calm peace. I have a great night\u2019s sleep. The next day we learn to make fire with our knife and a ferro rod, and purify creek water. While learning about local flora on a bush walk, Dedman throws impromptu challenges at us \u2013 five minutes to gather tinder and kindle and start a fire. All this skill-building has been working us up to the task of our third night \u2013 finding an ally or two, scoping out a safe spot and setting up an emergency base. I turn to my new friends Daniel and Damien and we set off, racing against our faux competition who have their sights set on the same campsite. We string up our reflective blankets at a tilt between two trees, light a fire, filter our creek water and prepare a hearty meal of kangaroo stew. We eat and chat beneath the night sky and I start to feel a little sad. This place is so beautiful and tomorrow I have to go home. \u201cI mean, just look around you,\u201d Carrick, a peer on the course, said earlier in the day. \u201cThis place is heaven right here. You don\u2019t need to look any further.\u201d Dedman\u2019s lessons differ depending on the environment. Here are a few general takeaways for when you are lost or stranded. Mindset is important. Panic is dangerous and can affect those around you. You need to be able to plan, act and hold the will to live. Make sure you think throughyour survival priorities. The rule of threes is governed by what will harm you first: you can survive just three minutes without air, three days without water and three weeks without food. Follow the PLAN acronym: protection (first aid, clothing, shelter, fire), location (attracting, holding and directing attention), acquisition (of water, then food) and navigation (orientation, travel, direction). When going anywhere remote, ensure you can be found. Have a satellite communication device like an EPIRB (emergency position-indicating radiobeacon) on you. Also take stock of everything you have that can attract attention in the natural environment \u2013 shiny, bright and reflective materials. You can set these up between trees as a method of passive signalling, fly a bright flag at the end of a big stick, or make a ground-to-air sign with letters. \u201cV\u201d is the international emergency distress symbol. A ground to air sign has to be 6m x 3m to be seen by a passing aerial vehicle or satellite. Search efforts are conducted in patterns. Aircraft will do a box search at the height they can see an animal move. A ground search will follow a track, a river, or man-made things such as telecommunication towers and windmills. Contour searches of mountains are conducted by circling. If you know these patterns, you can set your signalling to capitalise on where you will most likely be seen.

        "raw_text": "New Matildas coach Joe Montemurro has revealed star player Sam Kerr has had to undergo another mystery surgery, as questions swirl about her anticipated comeback. Kerr has suffered complications and setbacks since tearing her anterior cruciate ligament at a training camp with Chelsea in January 2024. Her rehabilitation has gone well beyond the usual 12-month return period, and shehasn\u2019t played for club or country for 17 months. Kerr\u2019s return to the field has been protracted in comparison to Matildas teammate Amy Sayer who tore her ACL last May and is back playing. It emerged on Monday that in recent weeks Kerr had undergone an additional surgery. It\u2019s understood that Kerr\u2019s recent trip to Melbourne, where she was spotted at the A-League Women grand final, was related to this treatment. She was seen alongside Matildas chief physiotherapist and ACL specialist Matt Whalan on May 18. On Monday, Montemurro confirmed to Network Ten Kerr had an \u201cintervention\u201d, but her knee was fine. When asked whether the surgery was a soft-tissue issue, Montemurro, told AAP: \u201cNo, I think it was just some scenario which happened a few weeks ago, or a couple of weeks ago. \u201cBut she\u2019s running and she\u2019s back and we\u2019re working closely with Chelsea to make sure that her progress is done right. \u201cBy all signs, everything\u2019s positive and we\u2019re all on the same page. But yeah, I don\u2019t see any issues. \u201cTo be honest, I just got some very vague reports. It was all very precautionary. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about, she\u2019s on track.\u201d Montemurro said he was optimisticKerr was finally on track in her prolonged return, with her sights set on performing at the Asian Cup. Football Australia has also ramped up its involvement in her rehabilitation, in conjunction with her English club. Kerr, 31, has never played under Montemurro for club or country. He coached against her with Melbourne Victory and Melbourne City, when she starred for Perth Glory, then later led Arsenal and Juventus against her Chelsea team. Being able to deploy the superstar striker alongside Caitlin Foord is an exciting prospect for Montemurro. \u201cBy all reports she\u2019s focused on getting back and she\u2019s focused on being back at her best, knowing that there\u2019s an exciting tournament (the Asian Cup) coming up,\u201d he said. \u201cSo with that attitude, I expect to see a fantastic Sam Kerr.\u201d Montemurro has already made it clear he won\u2019t have discussions over bigger-picture issues, like whether Kerr will continue as captain, until she is fully fit. He is yet to speak to Kerr, who returned to the Matildas fold in March and April, with Chelsea\u2019s blessing, to work on her rehabilitation. That will happen over the next two weeks, along with his conversations with other players. Fowler, Ellie Carpenter, Mackenzie Arnold, Katrina Gorry and Hayley Raso also weren\u2019t in camp when Montemurro addressed the group for the first time on Monday. \u201cI haven\u2019t had the opportunity,\u201d he said of chatting with Kerr. \u201cI actually spoke to the players yesterday and basically said that we\u2019ll be touching base over the next couple of weeks and putting in some plans from an individual perspective, leading into the next camp, to give them some understanding on what we want to do.\u201d -with AAP",

        "raw_text": "Sam Kerr\u2019s future as Matildas captain will be decided when she is back at full fitness, according to new national team coach Joe Montemurro. Montemurro,who was unveiled as Australia coach in Sydney on Mondayon a three-year deal, said he was confident Mary Fowler would be fit and firing for next year\u2019s Women\u2019s Asian Cup, but would make no decision on Kerr\u2019s future until she returned to play. The former Arsenal and Juventus women\u2019s manager declared that under his watch the Matildas would be a team that attacked and took risks, regardless of who they faced. But Australia\u2019s fortunes in the final third will hinge on the fitness of Kerr and Fowler. Both have been sidelined with anterior cruciate ligament injuries in the time since the 2023 World Cup. Kerr has not played for Australia in close to two years after suffering a knee injury in December 2024. The Chelsea striker, 31, has returned to training in recent months but is yet to play a game. \u201cMy intention is to sit down with all the players, even the extended squad, and map out a process of what\u2019s required to play the brand of football that we want to play from a physical and a mental perspective,\u201d Montemurro said. \u201cYou can get fit, you can get right tactically but then some players go through processes where [they ask] are they mentally prepared for a big tournament?\u201d he added. \u201cSam fits into that scenario where we\u2019re just going to monitor and see where she\u2019s at. \u201cLet\u2019s get her fit then we\u2019ll have those discussions [over the captaincy].\u201d Fowler, meanwhile, suffered her rupture in April. The 22-year-old Manchester City attacker faces a race against the clock to get fit for a home Asian Cup in March next year. \u201cMary\u2019s a special player and I can tell you from a club perspective, she\u2019s in the eye of a lot of the big clubs,\u201d Montemurro said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate for her, it happens, but she\u2019s in probably the best environment with the City Group. \u201cFrom a physical and from a training load [perspective] and from a return to play scenario, she\u2019ll be right and hopefully she\u2019ll be right for the Asian Cup.\u201d The Matildas play a friendly against Argentina in Canberra on Monday night.

        "raw_text": "Joe Montemurro has been unveiled as the new coach of the Matildas, ending a controversial and drawn-out 10-month worldwide search. Montemurro has signed a three-year deal that runs until the end of the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028. The 55-year-old Australian, who most recently coached French giants Lyon, replaces Tony Gustavsson in an appointment that is long overdue. Gustavsson did not have his contract renewed after last August\u2019s group stage exit at the Paris Olympics. The Matildas have been in limbo since then. Football Australia had the chance to make a move on Montemurro, who missed out to Gustavsson in 2020, in the months leading up to the Olympics. The Melburnian coached the A-League Women All Stars in May 2024 when he was without a job. He then signed a deal with Lyon six weeks before the Paris Games, at a time it was widely known Gustavsson had no genuine appetite to extend his deal. The flow-on effect of FA\u2019s go-slow approach has been that the ageing Matildas squad has been treading water for the best part of a year. The belated appointment of Montemurro leaves Australia up against it heading into next year\u2019s Women\u2019s Asian Cup on home soil.

        "raw_text": "A crestfallen Alex de Minaur says he is burnt out and mentally weary after his a \u201cmiracle\u201d French Open capitulation, revealing it\u2019s time for him to change. The never-say-die \u201cDemon\u201d had never seemed so downcast as he when he tried to make sense of how he lost his second-round contest 2-6 2-6 6-4 6-3 6-2 to comeback wizard Alexander Bublik from a position on Thursday (local time) where \u201c99.9 per cent of the time\u201d he would have won. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for myself, what happened today. I need to look at myself in the mirror and find out the reason, because ultimately this isn\u2019t going to change. I have to adapt and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d the world No.9 lamented afterwards. With de Minaur knocked out for early for the first time in his past\u00a0seven grand slams and Brisbane\u2019s Adam Walton bowing out to No.17 seed Andrey Rublev 7-6 (7-1) 6-1 7-6 (7-5) later on Thursday, Alexei Popyrin is the only Aussie left in the men\u2019s draw at Roland Garros. In the women\u2019s draw, a doughty late-night 6-4 6-2 win over French wildcard Leolia Jeanjean by 17th seed Daria Kasatkina, in her first grand slam representing Australia, has set up a third-round blockbuster date with Spanish No.10 seed Paula Badosa. De Minaur\u2019s defeat came in a wildly entertaining affair, the ultimate \u201cmatch of two halves\u201d. A famously eccentric Kazhak, Bublik admitted the 11am start was too early for a sleepyhead like him. He said he was already thinking about getting an early flight home to Monaco before deciding to throw caution to the wind after being outplayed for two sets. But though Bublik stirred to provide some out-of-the-box brilliance, de Minaur could only feel this was one that criminally got away \u2013 and he couldn\u2019t understand how. \u201cNo illness, no injury. Look, I\u2019m just tired. I\u2019m tired mentally. I\u2019m a little bit burnt out, if anything,\u201d he said. Suggesting he\u2019d lost the match rather than Bublik winning, he added: \u201cI lost that one. Looking back at my grand slam career, I can\u2019t think of another match where I felt this way and ended up losing a match that I win 99.9 per cent of the time. \u201cIn a way, the good thing is that today is something like a miracle, in the sense that I\u2019m not known for these types of performances. I\u2019m probably known for the opposite, which is just being consistent and not losing really matches that I shouldn\u2019t be losing.\u201d It was a crushing blow for the 26-year-old Sydneysider, who\u2019d been enjoying his best clay-court season and was ready to build on his breakthrough quarter-final appearance last year. \u201cObviously have to have a hard chat with the team and analyse everything that\u2019s been happening, kind of find a reason of why this happened,\u201d he said. He also complained about there being \u201ctoo much tennis\u201d and the ATP needing a shorter schedule, echoing fellow Aussie Jordan Thompson\u2019s complaints earlier in the week. Mainly though, de Minaur just sounded like a man in need of a break after 38 matches already this year. Ironically, his misery unfolded just as the sun came out for the first time these championships \u2013 conditions the Australian loves. For two sets he positively shone. Looking to have cracked the puzzle that is Bublik, making light of his crazy drop shots, suicidal monster second serves and one dismally executed underarm delivery, de Minaur waltzed two sets up in an hour. There was the odd dazzling shot \u2013 including one that sent de Minaur sliding into the courtside furniture \u2013 but it felt like Einstein\u2019s definition of insanity as he played drop shot after drop shot only to get the same result as the fastest man in tennis hunted them down. Then, a switch was flicked at two-sets down. Out went the drop shots, in came the power. \u201cI was checking the tickets already in my head. I didn\u2019t really care, in a way,\u201d Bublik said. De Minaur\u2019s composure evaporated as Bublik got the crowd behind him with musketeer shotmaking, like the point that won him the fourth, featuring a tweener followed by a brilliant backhand bullet down the line. No wonder the Kazakh took a deep bow. Bublik raced through the final set, taking his ace count to a dozen. For his piece de resistance, he finished the job, after de Minaur had saved three match points in the final game, with one rapier-like cross-court backhand winner, his 51st of a marvellously entertaining encounter. -AAP",

        "raw_text": "A Chinese paraglider is lucky to be alive after being sucked more than eight kilometres above the ground in a cloud vortex. Liu Ge, who filmed the ordeal,said he was trapped in freezing temperatures of as low as -40 degrees while flying above the Qilian Shan mountains in northern China on Saturday. Liu says he was pulled upward into the sky, in a process known as cloud suction, shortly after he jumped off a mountain, which was about three kilometres above sea level. Due to the extreme altitude, he said he had trouble breathing and his hands were freezing cold. \u201cI just kept communicating over the radio the entire time,\u201d he said. Liu had no oxygen mask and video of his flight shows his face and clothes covered in ice.He said suffered severe frostbite due to the freezing temperatures. Despite the lack of oxygen, Liu remained conscious throughout his ordeal and managed to land safely. A cloud vortex, also called a spout or eddy, isa rotating whirlwind of air within or beneath a cloud. In some cases the swirling air can be the precursor to a tornado. China\u2019s state-ownedGlobal Timesspoke to an experienced paraglider identified only as Ou who said Liu\u2019s survival was \u201cmiraculous\u201d. He said while there had been other cases around the world of cloud suction incidents reaching 6000-7000 meters, few people survived such extreme altitudes. \u201cThis is truly miraculous. His mental resilience was extraordinary,\u201d Ou said. Despite surviving the vortex, Liu\u2019s ordeal is not over. According to theGlobal Times, authorities have launched an investigation because air traffic authorities had not approved his flight plan after he failed to file the necessary paperwork. Chinese national aviation sports regulations state that even if a paraglider has a valid licence, they must first have airspace approval from air traffic control. Paragliding flights are banned above five kilometres. \u201cViolators may face corrective orders from local sports administrations, with penalties ranging from warnings and fines to criminal charges in severe cases,\u201d theGlobal Timesreported.",

        "raw_text": "NSW could be on the brink of back-to-back State of Origin series wins after its forwards set the platform for a historic 18-6 win at Suncorp Stadium. The Blues dominated Queensland on Wednesday night, with only missed conversions from all four tries stopping the scoreline from blowing out. After winning last year\u2019s decider in Brisbane, the victory marked the first time the Blues have breached the Suncorp fortress in successive games in 27 years. NSW have also now won three straight games for the first time in 19 years, after coming back from 1-0 down in last year\u2019s series. But of most importance to the Blues is they can win this year\u2019s series in Perth on June 18, with another chance in Sydney three weeks later. \u201cAny time you can come here and win you\u2019ve got to be happy, so extremely happy,\u201d Blues coach Laurie Daley said. \u201cBut it\u2019s only camp one. We\u2019ll see what [Queensland] are like when they bounce into game two. \u201cBecause one thing I know about Origin is there\u2019s always a response. You get hit in the face, there\u2019s a response next game.\u201d Maroons five-eighth Cameron Munster said Queensland needed to \u201cplay smarter\u201d. \u201cWe played some dumb footy and gave them too many opportunities,\u201d he told the Nine Network. For all its dominance, NSW was still made to sweat for its win. After leading 14-0 just before the break, it lost Brian To\u2019o to the sin-bin on the stroke of halftime when he tackled Xavier Coates in midair as the Maroons winger attempted to plant a try. There was no penalty try but it did leave the Blues exposed at the start of the second half. They looked up to the task when six men bundled Valentine Holmes into touch. But from the next play Coates scored, Jeremiah Nanai\u2019s pinpoint hit on Latrell Mitchell sending the ball loose and the Maroons pouncing. At 14-6 it was still anyone\u2019s game, both sides error-riddled under fatigue as the quality descended. Two-try hero Zac Lomax and Connor Watson combined to produce the moment, both somehow popping offloads in tackles allowing Dylan Edwards to score the clincher with eight minutes to play. Halves Mitchell Moses and Nathan Cleary clicked in their partnership debut for NSW while Stephen Crichton shrugged off his early-week injury crisis. Mitchell was also immense in his Origin return at centre. That was all made possible by a dominant Blues pack, with man-of-the-match Payne Haas topping 150 metres after barely training on a quad tear in the build up. \u201cFor a big bloke and limited prep to jump out of the ground and do what he did was inspirational,\u201d Daley said. The Blues\u2019 go-forward quietened the capacity crowd in the first half, with the Maroons giving away three ruck penalties inside the first 10 minutes to gift the visitors field position. Harry Grant was ineffective at hooker while Pat Carrigan missed five tackles and had the Maroons pack\u2019s only tackle break at half-time, compared to 12 from the Blues forwards. \u201cThey were much better than us. I feel pretty flat to be honest about our performance,\u201d Queensland coach Billy Slater said. \u201cThe flatness comes from how we hurt ourselves. Very ill-disciplined in the first half, and then that just snowballed against us.\u201d Queensland has scored just one try in their last two games at Suncorp, with that coming when the Blues were down a man on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s not good. That\u2019s not a good stat,\u201d Slater said. \u201cProbably as disappointing as the performance tonight.\u201d NSW\u2019s dominance didn\u2019t show on the scoreboard until later in the half on Wednesday, with Haas breaking the line and offloading before Lomax scored. To\u2019o crossed four minutes later, Mitchell\u2019s brilliant, mid-air offload setting that try up before a slick left-to-right movement allowed Lomax to score his second. -AAP",

        "raw_text": "There was tennis apparently going on somewhere out there at Roland Garros \u2026 It\u2019s just you may never have known, such was the extraordinary outpouring of emotion engendered by the scene-stealing return of Rafa Nadal to his Philippe Chatrier kingdom on Sunday, complete with tears, cheers and a reunion for the sport\u2019s \u2018Fab Four\u2019. So it was that Rafa\u2019s old one-man show, now all sober and besuited with not a bandana in sight, was enough to effortlessly eclipse all the action going on around the outside courts, and why wouldn\u2019t it? The \u2018King of Clay\u2019 had retired last year, but to his Roland Garros disciples, that was simply unbearable. He could never be replaced, and here was one last chance for them to salute their blessed Rafa with a special ceremony two decades exactly to the day he first walked on to the centre court for a match against Xavier Malisse that launched sport\u2019s most freakish monopoly. Of course, Roland Garros did it in style, unveiling its unique and permanent tribute to the great man \u2013 his footprint set into the clay of the court \u2013 while 10,000, dolled up in their clay-coloured \u2018Merci Rafa\u2019 T-shirts, paid homage. Amid it all, the ever humble 14-time champ himself couldn\u2019t possibly survive this mass onslaught of love and, after watching a real weepie of a film outlining his unreal French Open domination from sleeveless teen to balding warrior, the tears inevitably came. \u201cMerci beaucoup,\u201d he spluttered. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to start after playing on that court for the last 20 years, after enjoying, suffering, winning, losing and especially after having felt so many feelings every time I\u2019ve had the chance to be here.\u201d Cue more roars as Nadal\u2019s adopted home saluted its most beloved visitor. \u201cMerci la France, merci Paris,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have given me emotions and moments I could never have imagined.\u201d He was joined on court by Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray and Roger Federer, sport\u2019s most famous boy band back together, while in the stands, reigning champs Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek applauded, doubtless relieved they\u2019d managed to snag a ticket. Elsewhere, the big hitters weren\u2019t let loose around the grounds, as if to leave the stage free for just one man, but of the post-Nadal-era contenders, eighth seed Lorenzo Musetti best looked the part as he pounded German qualifier Yannick Hanfmann 7-5 6-2 6-0. There was a distinct US flavour to proceedings with No.12 seed Tommy Paul beating Dane Elmer Moller 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 6-3 6-1 and 15th seed Frances Tiafoe downing Roman Safiullin 6-4 7-5 6-4. The last word though, of course had to go to Nadal on a day like this. Talking of his old foes who had come to salute him, he said of Federer, Djokovic and Murray: \u201cIt\u2019s a great message for the world that the toughest rivalries probably in the history of our sport are able to be good colleagues, to respect each other. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to hate the opponent to try to beat him with all your forces.\u201d No sentiment seemed to sum up the man better. -AAP",

        "raw_text": "Ange Postecoglou has delivered the greatest triumph of his career, clutching a potentially job-saving lifeline by steering beleaguered Tottenham Hotspur to Europa League glory in Spain. The Melbourne-raised trailblazer became the first Australian manager to win a trophy in a major European club competition as Spurs beat fellow Premier League strugglers Manchester United 1-0 in Bilbao on Wednesday night (local time) for their first silverware in 17 years. A scrappy first-half goal from Brennan Johnson was ultimately enough to give Tottenham victory in a poor-quality match during which it had to survive a tsunami of late pressure from Ruben Amorim\u2019s otherwise feeble United. But as a beaming Postecoglou celebrated the drought-busting victory at the San Mames Stadium, the only question that remained was whether victory, which guarantees Champions League football for Spurs next season, would be enough to save the 59-year-old from the sack. It\u2019s said he is already doomed, regardless of the result. If so, what a glorious way for \u201cBig Ange\u201d to make what match-winner Johnson called a glorious \u201cmike drop\u201d exit \u2013 with Tottenham\u2019s first European trophy for 41 years. Postecoglou chose this moment of glory to declare his intent: \u201cI do [want to stay]. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve completed the job here. \u201cThe moment I accepted the role, I had one thing in my head, and that is to win something \u2013 and we\u2019ve done that now. I want to build on it.\u201d Goalscorer Johnson paid tribute to Postecoglou, saying: \u201cHe\u2019s done his job. He says he wins in his second year and he has \u2013 and if there\u2019s ever a time for a mike drop, it\u2019s now.\u201d But referring to his now-celebrated early season observation that he always wins a trophy in his second season, Postecoglou said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me boasting. It was me just making a declaration \u2013 and I believed it. \u201cI know our league form\u2019s been terrible (finishing 17th), nowhere near good enough and unacceptable, but us finishing third wasn\u2019t going to change his football club. The only thing that was going to change this football club is us winning something, and when I said that, that was my intent. \u201cIf I fell short. I was happy to cop it, but I believed it inside me. That was my ambition. I wanted it stated \u2013 and I was prepared to wear it if it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d It did happen \u2013 and his players wanted to remind everyone about Postecoglou\u2019s quote as they carried around a banner proclaiming it. There\u2019s no question they\u2019re 100 per cent behind Postecoglou and his Australian staff, Nick Montgomery, Sergio Raimundo and Mile Jedinak. No matter that salvation came from a wretchedly ordinary affair to climax Europe\u2019s second-tier continental competition, one befitting two mediocre EPL sides who\u2019ve lost 44 games between them this season. Not that the Spurs\u2019 faithful will care one jot after they prevailed in this survival of the unfittest, eventually winning thanks to Johnson\u2019s scruffy goal and defensive heroics from defender Micky van de Ven and goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario. Rasmus Hojlund had a header cleared amazingly and acrobatically off the line by van de Ven. Vicario, who\u2019d already made a key second-half save from Alejandro Garnacho, pulled off another superb stop in the 97th minute from Luke Shaw\u2019s header. And Postecoglou deserved praise for getting so much right in the final. Supposedly too gung-ho and careless in approach, and too stubborn to plump for conservatism when required, the striking thing about Tottenham\u2019s late-season European march has been his pragmatism. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that kind of knockout football is different from league football. It comes down to really good organisation, having a real clear game plan,\u201d he said. \u201cI always felt comfortable that if we got ahead, that we could sort of negate most of what Man U were going to throw at us.\u201d That\u2019s what Spurs did. Johnson\u2019s goal effectively summed up the game \u2013 a messy affair three minutes before halftime as he may \u2013 or may not have \u2013 got the final touch to deflect the ball into the net from Pape Sarr\u2019s right-footed cross that ricocheted off the hapless Shaw. From then on, Tottenham was happy to settle for what it had, because what it had meant the world. \u201cEver since I came here, it was \u2018Tottenham are a good team but they can never get it done\u2019,\u201d beamed Johnson. \u201cWe got it done.\u201d -AAP",

        "raw_text": "The tragic death of former West Coast premiership player Adam Selwood at just 41 is another devastating reminder of the mental health epidemic gripping young Australians. This is especially so for men \u2013 including those who once seemed invincible on the field. Selwood\u2019s passing isn\u2019t just a personal tragedy for his family, it\u2019s a national crisis behoving a national response. In the footy world, symbolism matters. The AFL has turned themed rounds into cultural cornerstones \u2013 from the magnificent Indigenous round to AFLW Pride Round, Anzac Day and the more recent Gather Round \u2013 each designed to celebrate, educate or commemorate. Yet one gaping omission persists \u2013 mental health. In an era where the greatest sport on this Earth prides itself on being \u201cmore than just a game\u201d, this oversight borders on negligence. According to Australian Bureau of Statistics data, suicide is the leadingcause for one in three men and women aged 15-24and more than one in five people aged 25-44 in 2023\u2013 the AFL\u2019s core demographics, and the age bracket of most players. Suicide accounts for nearly double the next highest causes \u2013 accidental poisoning and land transport accidents. The 25-44 age group graphically illustrates the maleness of our national crisis: In 2023, 15.4 per cent of deaths in females aged 25-44 were due to suicide, but for males that number is 25.1 per cent. These aren\u2019t just statistics,they\u2019re stories of mates, sons and daughters, mums and dads \u2013 and yes, players \u2013 lost to mental illness. They include the names we dare not forget \u2013 Shane Tuck, Cam McCarthy, Selwood\u2019s twin Troy, and perhaps most poignantly, Danny \u201cSpud\u201d Frawley. Frawley\u2019s death in 2019shocked the footy world, not least because of his post-playing role as a mental health advocate. A fierce competitor turned gentle educator; Frawley laid bare his own battles in the hope that others might find strength in speaking up. His legacy lives on in Spud\u2019s Game, a fixture launched by St Kilda \u2013 the club he loved \u2013 to honour his mission. \u201cSpud\u2019s Game: Time 2 Talk\u201d has grown into a powerful, moving tribute. It\u2019s more than a football match. It\u2019s a platform for conversation, a fundraiser for mental health initiatives, and a living reminder of how silence can turn to tragedy. And yet, while Spud\u2019s Game is admirable, it remains a club-led initiative. The AFL supports it, promotes it, but still hasn\u2019t gone further. Why not elevate it? Why not enshrine it across all nine games in a dedicated Mental Health Round? Not just to honour Frawley, but to honour everyone in the footy community \u2013 from local volunteers to elite athletes \u2013 who grapples with the black dog. Contrast this with the league\u2019s response to other worthy causes. The Indigenous Round, now Sir Doug Nicholls Round, has rightly grown into one of the most celebrated weeks on the calendar. Pride Round, too, has opened hearts and minds. Breast cancer, motor neurone disease, gender equity, domestic violence \u2013 all find space on the AFL stage. Yet the leading cause of death for young and middle-aged women and men? This must change now. This isn\u2019t a call to abandon any existing rounds \u2013 far from it. It\u2019s a plea to add one more, as leading former player mental health advocate Wayne Schwass urges. Done properly, it could be transformative. AFL and local footy clubs could share player stories, partner with mental health organisations, offer free counselling services at games, and spark difficult conversations among fans. And most importantly, it could save lives. One of the AFL\u2019s greatest strengths is its emotional grip on Australians, especially blokes. It can reach people where government campaigns and health ads fall short. When a club like Richmond speaks, its fans listen. When a player opens up about their mental health, it resonates across locker rooms, pubs, andliving roomsin a way few institutions can. The AFL Players Association has made mental health a key concern. But without the league throwing its full weight behind the cause, we\u2019re left with piecemeal programs and after-the-fact tributes. It shouldn\u2019t take another tragic death for the AFL to act. Yes, some might argue we already talk about mental health \u201cenough\u201d. But if that were true, suicide wouldn\u2019t be our leading cause of death for people in their prime. If that were true, we wouldn\u2019t lose former elite athletes \u2013 men who appeared strong, fit, and invincible \u2013 to darkness and desperate acts. If that were true, thousands of ordinary footy fans wouldn\u2019t be suffering in silence. The AFL has made progress. Coaches and the media speak more openly about stress, anxiety, and depression. We see fewer eye rolls when players take time off to protect their mental health. Regardless, it\u2019s easy to hold themed rounds when the issues are uncontroversial or celebratory. It\u2019s harder when the subject is uncomfortable, messy, and ongoing. Exactly why we need a Mental Health Round. To pierce the silence. To name the problem. To put resources behind it. To honour those we\u2019ve lost, and support those still fighting. The AFL has a platform. It has money. It has influence. And a moral obligation to act. A dedicated AFL Mental Health Round would be a bloody good place to start. Lifeline 131 114 beyondblue 1300 224 636 Nick Dyrenfurth is executive director of the John Curtin Research Centre.",

        "raw_text": "The Victorian Government is tight-lipped on the cost of luring golf star Rory McIlroy to Melbourne, but Golf Australia boss James Sutherland says the amount could have been much higher. GA confirmed that five-time major champion and career grand slam winner McIlroy will headline this year\u2019s Australian Open and has also committed to play in 2026. Royal Melbourne on the Melbourne sandbelt will host the tournament from December 4-7 while nearby Kingston Heath is the home of the Open next year. Sutherland said that talks started with the world No.2 before his historic win at the 2025 Masters Tournament, which completed the career grand slam. That victory made McIlroy the most valuable commodity in world golf and able to command a multi-million-dollar appearance fee. \u201cThankfully, the conversation was happening before the Masters,\u201d Sutherland said at the announcement at Royal Melbourne on Wednesday morning. \u201cWe did have a moment there where, when he won the Masters, thinking, \u2018Oh, what are the implications of this? Maybe he\u2019s going to get offers from all over the world, and maybe the numbers will be different. \u201cBut fortunately Rory has been completely true to his word.\u201d McIlroy claimed the Stonehaven Cup in 2013 in a titanic battle at Royal Sydney with Adam Scott, who was in career-best form, before returning the following year to unsuccessfully defend his title at The Australian. Sutherland said playing on Melbourne\u2019s sandbelt was a lure for 35-year-old McIlroy, which helped secure him for a two-year deal. \u201cHe has for a long time expressed a desire to come here and play tournament golf on the sandbelt,\u201d Sutherland said. \u201cThe conversation\u2019s been going on for a long time, and fortunately nothing changed when he won the Masters \u2013 it just became an even more compelling proposition.\u201d McIlroy backed Sutherland\u2019s words in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be committing to the Australian Open for the next two years, especially with it being played on the world-class Melbourne sandbelt, somewhere I\u2019ve always wanted to play\u202fprofessionally\u201d McIlroy said. Like when former world No.1 Tiger Woods played in the Open in 2011, Sutherland said the appearance of the Northern Irishman would help elevate the status of the tournament and he expected a \u201cvery strong line-up\u201d. He predicted crowds to swamp the course given the popularity of McIlroy. \u201cThe popularity of Rory cuts across generations, but it also cuts across nationality,\u201d Sutherland said. \u201cEven at Augusta a few weeks ago, an Irishman going head to head with an American, Rory was as popular as any player on the course and the cheers for Rory\u2019s success and desire for him to win is huge. \u201cOver the weekend, the number of ticket enquiries we had was absolutely phenomenal.\u201d With the Open format moving away from the divisive combined event with the women\u2019s and all-abilities, Sutherland hoped to see leading local golfers such as Scott, who missed last year\u2019s tournament, sign on. \u201cTalking to the Australian golfers, it\u2019s very clear how much the Australian Open means to them and they\u2019re very proud of it and want it to be successful,\u201d Sutherland added. \u201cAdam is one of a number of current day players that have their name on the trophy but I know he would absolutely love to have his name on it again so we would be very optimistic about Adam being here to play as well.\u201d -AAP",

With the Italian Open only now beginning to get to its second-week business end in Rome, the Australian singles interest has already once again been left resting solely on the shoulders of Alex de Minaur. \u2018Demon\u2019 was left to fly the flag alone after the tame exit of Alexei Popyrin against former winner Daniil Medvedev on the SuperTennis Arena on Sunday which continues the Canadian Open winner\u2019s difficult 2025 campaign. Medvedev marched to a comfortable 6-4 6-1 victory in an hour and 26 minutes, with Popyrin evidently frustrated by his own failings as he clocked up 28 unforced errors to take his season\u2019s record to 6-10, a disappointing follow-up to his breakthrough 2024 campaign.  With the French Open just a fortnight away, the Australian contingent\u2019s recent struggles on clay have been striking.

Elsewhere in the men\u2019s draw on Sunday, the big guns began to fire with title holder Alexander Zverev strolling into the last 16 with a 6-4 6-0 win over Lithuanian qualifier Vilius Gaubas. Third seed Carlos Alcaraz then continued his impressive reurn from injury with a 7-6 (7-2) 6-2 victory over Serbian Laslo Djere on the main Campo Centrale arena. Earlier, Stefanos Tsitsipas had ended up in a heated and lengthy discussion with his conqueror Arthur Fils after his 2-6 6-4 6-2 defeat, with the umpire having to come down off his chair and keep a close eye on the pair as supporters in the SuperTennis Arena jeered and whistled. The animated head-to-head centred on a moment when Tsitsipas tagged Fils with a booming backhand during the second set, with the 20-year-old Frenchman apparently using it as his fuel for victory. But there appeared no bad blood between the pair as they left the arena following the discussion. British star Jack Draper recorded his 100th tour win but admitted his frustration had boiled over as he smashed a racquet en route to beating Czech qualifier Vit Kopria 6-4 6-3. \u2014AAP",

Piastri claimed his third straight race win after starting fourth at Hard Rock Stadium on Monday (AEST), joined on the podium by teammate Lando Norris.

It looked, at best, like the start of a long-term plan to lay claim to and develop a promising youngster, at worst a gimmick. No one is sceptical now. In his third match the now 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi has smashed the second-fastest century in the IPL\u2019s 18 seasons, a blistering 35-ball display that carried his team to a thumping eight-wicket victory over Gujarat Titans in Jaipur on Monday. Only \u201cUniverse Boss\u201d Chris Gayle has hit a quicker IPL ton than his fellow left-hander, and \u201cBaby Boss\u201d Suryavanshi would have been close to his 30-ball display had he not played himself in with nine runs off his first seven balls, albeit that included a straight six off 140km/h Indian Test seamer Ishant Sharma. Thereafter he hit 92 off 28 balls, including 10 more sixes and seven fours. A couple of boundaries were streaky, but most were hit with devastating power and fearless clean hitting all around the wicket. His century was brought up with a six over midwicket, off the skilled legspinner Rashid Khan. Every boundary was rapturously cheered by the pink-clad Royals fans in the \u2018Pink City\u2019, none of whom will ever forget the night. By the time Suryavanshi was yorked for 101, the Royals were well on the way to overhauling Titans\u2019 4-209, doing so with 25 balls to spare, to end a five-match losing streak. Yashasvi Jaiswal, dropped by wicketkeeper Jos Buttler on two, made 70 not out. \u201cIncredible innings, one of the best I have seen,\u201d said Jaiswal, who was hailed as a tyro when making Test and IPL centuries as a 21-year-old two years ago, of Suryavanshi, whose innings was made against a high-class attack of Test bowlers. \u201cI hope he will do it for us for a long time. \u201cI was telling him to just keep going. He just played amazing shots, he practises well, works hard in the nets. He has the game and temperament, I wish him all the luck.\u201d Shubman Gill, Gujarat\u2019s captain, who made 84 off 50 balls, backed up by Buttler\u2019s unbeaten 50 off 26, added: \u201cIt was Suryavanshi\u2019s day, his hitting was tremendous and he made full use of it.\u201d The boy was still taking it in. \u201cIt feels really good,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve been practising for the last three-four months, the result is showing. I don\u2019t see the ground so much, just focus on the ball. \u201cIt is like a dream, to score a century in the IPL.\u201d While the Titans, third with 12 points, are still well-placed to make the play-offs, the Royals (eighth, six points), are unlikely to do so. Nevertheless, they has provided what will probably be the most memorable occasion of the tournament. -AAP",

        "raw_text": "Andrew Flintoff has relived the horror of his life-changing car crash while filming theTop GearTV show, admitting his lowest moments left him wishing he\u2019d died. The former England cricket star suffered a serious accident while filming the popular BBC program in 2022, enduring major facial injuries. The incident took place on atTop Gear\u2018s test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome when the open-topped Morgan Super 3 Flintoff was driving flipped and slid, dragging him face down along the track. Flintoff speaks about the incident in depth for the first time in a new Disney+ documentaryFlintoff, which premieres on Friday, offering an unflinching account of the incident. The film contains still images from the scene of the accident and some graphic shots of his wounds, but Flintoff\u2019s account is even more harrowing. At one stage, he admits: \u201cAfter the accident I didn\u2019t think I had it in me to get through. This sounds awful \u2026 part of me wishes I\u2019d been killed. Part of me thinks, I wish I\u2019d died. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to kill myself \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t mistake the two things. I was not wishing, I was just thinking, \u2018this would have been so much easier\u2019,\u201d Flintoff says. \u201cNow I try to take the attitude that the sun will come up tomorrow and my kids will still give me a hug. I\u2019m probably in a better place now.\u201d The documentary, made by director John Dower, includes contributions from former teammates Michael Vaughan, Steve Harmison and Rob Key as well as family members and show business friends James Corden and Jack Whitehall. There is also an appearance by his surgeon Jahrad Haq, who describes Flintoff\u2019s injuries as one of the five worst he has come across in 20 years and likes the reconstruction process to a jigsaw with missing pieces. Haq said the injuries were \u201cvery complex\u201d \u2013 a mixture of hard and soft tissue injuries, broken teeth, lost teeth and elements of the upper jaw bone that were also fractured and displaced. \u201c[He] lost a really significant portion of his upper lip \u2013 the skin and some of the underlying muscle, and also his lower lip,\u201d he said. Flintoff reveals he demanded to see footage of the crash and talks at length about the terror he felt in the moment. \u201cI remember my head got hit, I got dragged out. I went over the back of the car and it pulled my face down on the runway, about 50 metres, underneath the car,\u201d he said. \u201cMy biggest fear was, I didn\u2019t think I had a face. I thought my face had come off. I was frightened to death.\u201d The BBC \u201crested\u201d Top Gear for the foreseeable future in 2023 after reaching a financial settlement with Flintoff, an agreement reportedly worth around \u00a39 million ($19 million). The 47-year-old appears resentful about the entertainment culture he was involved in, likening it to his own injury-ravaged playing career. \u201cEverybody wants more. Everybody want to dig that bit deeper,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned this in sport as well. All the injuries, all the injections, all the times I got sent out on a cricket field and treated like a piece of meat. That\u2019s TV and sport. It\u2019s quite similar, you\u2019re just a commodity. You\u2019re a piece of meat.\u201d The documentary ends with its subject back involved in the sport that made his name, as head coach of England Lions and Northern Superchargers, and back in the television studio in a reboot of darts showBullseye. He appears optimistic about the future, despite regular flashbacks to the accident, and states: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to be better \u2026 just different now. I\u2019m getting there slowly.\u201d Wife Rachael later concludes: \u201cI do think cricket saved him.

        "raw_text": "Australia\u2019s 17-year-old sprinting sensation Gout Gout has blitzed yet another milestone on his way to global domination. Gout clocked in at 19.84 seconds to win the men\u2019s 200-metre finalat the Australian Athletics Championships in Perthlast weekend. The effort would have secured the Queensland teenager a record, but for an illegal wind speed of 2.2 metres a second. Even more astonishingly, advanced biomechanical analysis by Flinders University has found that Gout\u2019s maximum step length during the race matched that of Usain Bolt during his 100-metre world record in the 2009 Berlin World Championships. Movement scientist Dr Dylan Hicks said Gout\u2019s average step length in the final 100 metres was 2.69 metres, peaking at an extraordinary 2.86 metres \u2013 equal to Bolt\u2019s maximum step length during his 100-metre world record in Berlin in 2009, \u201cwhich appears key to his record performance\u201d. The 17-year-old created worldwide headlines last week after twice running the 100-metre sprint in Perth in 9.99 seconds. Neither counted as an official time given the strong tailwind. On Sunday, Gout sent WA Athletics Stadium into overdrive when he ran the 200m in 19.84 seconds. This time the tailwind was only marginally over the legal limit. The speed means the young athlete\u2019s quest to officially go sub-10 in the 100 metres and sub-20 in the 200 metres continues. \u201cThese are the steps you take to the top, and the steps I have to take to potentially become a world champion or an Olympic champion,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I can get these little steps, focus on the little things, I think I can take it far.\u201d For his part, Bolt has also noticed the rising Australia. \u201cHe looks like young me,\u201dhe wrote on Instagramfollowing a video of a Gout performance back in December. Gout is indeed shaping up as a global sprinting great, which Hicks has attributed to a combination of \u201cunique coordination patterns, biomechanics, technical efficiency\u201d. In addition to Gout\u2019s remarkable step length, Hicks said the young star\u2019s speed had improved in the first 100 metres \u201cfrom 9.37 metres a second (which took him 10.67 seconds) in his 19.98-second [200-metre race at the Queensland Athletics Championships] last month to 9.59 metres a second (10.43 seconds) in Perth.\u201d Combined with his ability to maintain speed throughout the race, this helped Gout run his (almost) record-breaking time. But, according to Hicks, it\u2019s Gout\u2019s unique movement signature \u2013 how his foot interacts with the ground \u2013 that really stands out. \u201cI believe it is Gout\u2019s unique ability to store and release elastic strain energy via the muscle-achilles tendon unit which provides a greater force amplification effect (between the foot and the ground) \u2014 allowing Gout to move faster for longer, with less energy cost,\u201d he said. \u201cAlong with good coaching and hard work, this biomechanical difference appears to set Gout apart from almost anyone else in the world.\u201d Gout will have his next race at the Stawell Gift meet in western Victoria over the Easter long weekend.

        "raw_text": "Matildas star Mary Fowler has ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and is in a race against time to play in next year\u2019s home Asian Cup. Manchester City had been hopeful the brilliant winger had avoided the dreaded injury, suffered when she appeared to wrench her right knee while overstretching for the ball on Sunday. The injury forced Fowler out of the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United, which City ultimately lost 2-0, inside 20 minutes. City interim manager Nick Cushing had admitted it \u201cdoesn\u2019t look great imminently\u201d but said City were \u201cnot fearing the worst.\u201d But scans confirmed the 22-year-old had suffered the dreaded injury, which means a full knee reconstruction. \u201cManchester City can confirm Mary Fowler has suffered a rupture to her anterior cruciate ligament,\u201d City said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cMary will remain under the care of the club\u2019s medical team and start her rehabilitation. \u201cEveryone at City wishes Mary all the best on a full and speedy recovery.\u201d It will likely rule Fowler out for close to a year, in a hammer blow to Australia\u2019s hopes next March of winning the Women\u2019s Asian Cup for the first time since 2010. The attacker has been in dynamic form for City, scoring 10 goals across all competitions, and underlined her ability with a starring role in Australia\u2019s friendlies against South Korea earlier this month. \u201cI\u2019m really disappointed to be facing some time out of the game,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cIt\u2019s never easy when something like this happens especially when you\u2019ve been working so hard and feeling good. \u201cThe road ahead will be challenging, but I\u2019m ready to take it on. \u201cThere\u2019s still so much I want to achieve, and I\u2019ll be using this time to grow in every way I can. \u201cI\u2019m committed to doing the work, staying positive and coming back better than ever.\u201d Fowler\u2019s injury also means the new Matildas coach, widely expected to be current Lyon boss Joe Montemurro, will be unable to call on her early in their tenure. \u201cEveryone in the Matildas and Football Australia family \u2013 players, coaches, and support staff \u2013 will be right behind Mary as she takes the first steps toward her comeback,\u201d interim coach Tom Sermanni said. Losing Fowler also piles more pressure on Arsenal star Caitlin Foord to be Australia\u2019s main attacking threat. The Matildas are still without skipper Sam Kerr, who suffered the second ruptured ACL of her career during a training camp with Chelsea in January 2024. Kerr, who joined her Matildas teammates in camp this month, is still considered several weeks away from playing. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to put a timeframe on it,\u201d Chelsea coach Sonia Bompastor said on the weekend.",

        "raw_text": "Rory McIlroy has defied another Masters meltdown to win in a playoff from Justin Rose and become the first European to secure a career grand slam more than a decade in the making. The Northern Irishman (11 under, 72, 66, 66, 73) was four shots clear through 10 holes on Sunday (local time). But, as he also did 14 years ago at Augusta National, he stumbled with five dropped shots as Rose (65, 71, 75, 66) surged to finish level. A bogey on the last hole of regulation forced a sudden-death playoff and both men had birdie putts on the first extra hole, McIlroy putting his approach to a metre after Rose\u2019s had settled 4\u00bd metres away. Rose\u2019s effort slid by, before McIlroy tapped in to clinch his maiden Masters title and first major in 11 years. The 35-year-old fell to the ground in relief after his putt dropped, having watched a 1\u00bd-metre par attempt on the same hole slide by minutes earlier that would have sealed the triumph in regulation. Tiger Woods was the last man to complete the set of all four majors when he dominated the British Open in his first attempt at the career grand slam in 2000. \u201cIt was 14 years in the making; I feel like I could have got it done there,\u201d McIlroy said of the 2011 Masters fadeout that has haunted him. \u201cThere was a lot of pent-up emotion that just came out on that 18th green \u201cA moment like that just makes \u2026 all the close calls worth it.\u201d Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus are the only other members of the career grand slam club. The roller-coaster final day started with McIlroy two shots clear of Bryson DeChambeau (seven under) with the American briefly leading after just two holes before fading as the chasing pack surged. Leading by four after the 10th, he dropped a shot on the 11th and then inexplicably found water with a wedge despite laying up on 13th. That fourth double bogey for his tournament is now a quirky record among champions. When his curling putt on the 14th sat on the lip of the cup but didn\u2019t drop and he\u2019d lost the lead. Rose, who led for a record fifth time after the first round, bogeyed the 17th but then drained a six-metre putt on the 18th to heap pressure on the leader. McIlroy found the sand with his wedge approach and then pulled his par putt to fall into the playoff. He delivered again with an iron, as he had done with scintillating approaches to the 15th and 17th for birdies, to secure victory. The whirlwind began on Thursday when McIlroy went back to par with a pair of double bogeys and sat seven behind fast-starting Rose. Only Nick Faldo in 1990 and Woods in 2005 had previously come from that far back after the opening round to win. But McIlroy launched his comeback with a back nine of 31 and exploded out of the blocks with a record six consecutive threes to start on Saturday. \u201cAll week I responded to setbacks,\u201d he said. Patrick Reed (nine under) holed out for eagle on the 17th to finish outright third. Scottie Scheffler (eight under) was fourth and Australian Jason Day dropped shots on the last two holes to finish five under and in a tie for eighth. Rose fell just short of executing the second-biggest Masters comeback after starting the final day seven shots behind. The former world No.1, US Open and Olympic champion, joins Greg Norman as a three-time Masters runner-up and Ben Hogan as the only loser of multiple playoffs after his 2017 defeat to Sergio Garcia. Min Woo Lee, Australia\u2019s only other cut survivor, was two over on Sunday to finish six over for the tournament in 49th. -AAP",

        "raw_text": "Veteran Rohan Browning has regained his mantle as Australia\u2019s 100m sprint champion, producing an equal personal best time of 10.01 seconds to pip Lachie Kennedy in a thrilling photo finish at the Australian Athletics Championships. Kennedy ran a personal-best 10.00 in his heat win at the WA Athletics Stadium on Friday, and immediately set his sights on bettering the Australian record of 9.93 set by Patrick Johnson in Japan in 2003. But it was veteran Browning who came up trumps in a photo finish in Saturday night\u2019s final in Perth, equalling his career-best run from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. Browning\u2019s final time of 10.01 (.001) bettered that of Kennedy 10.01 (.006) by five-thousandths of a second. Joshua Azzopardi (10.17) finished third. Many critics labelled Browning a spent force following some tough injury years, but the 27-year-old showed he still had plenty left in the tank. \u201cIt felt like Tokyo all over again. It felt really smooth,\u201d Browning said after Saturday\u2019s thrilling win. \u201cI knew not to get sucked into running Lachie\u2019s race, because he\u2019s going to get out well. \u201cI just had to focus on myself. There might have only been a handful of people in the stadium tonight that believed that was possible. And you know, you only need to believe in yourself.\u201d Rising global superstar Gout Gout didn\u2019t compete in the open men\u2019s field. Instead, he produced two runs of 9.99 in the under-20 100m sprint on Thursday, but both were achieved with illegal tail winds. It means Gout\u2019s personal best remains 10.17 seconds. In the women\u2019s 100m final on Saturday night, national record holder Torrie Lewis beat 17-year-old rising star Leah O\u2019Brien and Bree Rizzo in a drama-filled photo-finish. It took several minutes for the winner to be determined given the closeness of the race. Lewis recorded a time of 11.24 (.236), ahead of O\u2019Brien 11.24 (.240) and Rizzo (11.25). \u201cI\u2019m so happy,\u201d Lewis said after defending her national crown. \u201cI just said to them, \u2018That was such a crazy race guys. I\u2019m happy for both of you\u2019. Whoever gets it, gets it.\u201d Olympic silver medallist Jessica Hull won the 1500m women\u2019s national title for the third year running after going for broke with 400m to go. The pace was slow for most of the race, but Hull was able to create enough of a gap to win in 4:11.36, just ahead of Sarah Billings (4:11.51) and Georgia Griffith (4:12.09). \u201cIt was a very strange race,\u201d said Hull, who was competing just days after taking part in the grand slam track meet in Jamaica. \u201cI think in my mind, I kind of probably thought Linden (Hall) would take up the running. In the first 200 she was boxed in on the rail pretty deep. \u201cI was like, \u2018OK, it\u2019s not going to be Linden and I don\u2019t think anyone else is going to go, so just buckle up for the last 400\u2019.\u201d In the men\u2019s 1500m final, 18-year-old rising star Cameron Myers (3:34.39) held on at the death to beat Adam Spencer (3:34.57) and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Oliver Hoare (3:34.61). -AAP",

        "raw_text": "Lachie Kennedy has set his sights on becoming the fastest Australian sprinter of all time after running a historic 10 seconds flat at the Australian Athletics Championships in Perth. Kennedy recorded the second-fastest time for the 100-metre sprint in Australian athletic history. It followed 17-year-old headline grabber Gout Gout running 9.99 seconds \u2014 but with an illegal assisted tailwind \u2014 just 24 hours earlier in the Under-20 100m sprint. It means Gout\u2019s official best remains 10.17. Kennedy flew down the running track to blitz the open men\u2019s field in his first-round heat on Friday, with a time of 10.00 with a legal 0.9 m/s tailwind. Remarkably, Kennedy achieved the time without pushing his body to the max. The fastest Australian time of 9.93 seconds is still held by Patrick Johnson who achieved the feat in Mito, Japan in 2003. Kennedy now ranks second with his 10.00. Rohan Browning (9.96 seconds) and Gout (9.99 seconds) have broken the 10-second mark, but only with illegal tailwinds. Kennedy, who will run in the semi-finals and final on Saturday, now has his sights set on the Australian record. \u201cIt feels pretty good. Hopefully I can be the quickest ever by the end of the week,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cAndrew (Iselin) my coach was telling me to give it everything, because he thought it was going to be the best conditions. \u201cBut I really want to save all my juice for the final, because I want the final to be intense. \u201cI might have subconsciously shut off. Like I was staring at the clock with 30 metres to go, and I was like, \u2018I might actually get this\u2019. \u201cWith a dip, it could have been nine, but I\u2019ve got two more races to do that.\u201d On a lightning-fast night in Perth for the 100m heats, Rohan Browning posted a wind-assisted 10.07, Sebastian Sultana recorded a legal 10.12, and Calab Law posted a wind-assisted 10.13. Jack Hale also put in a promising display with his legal time of 10.23. Kennedy and Gout will go head-to-head in the 200m on Sunday in what is shaping as another mouth-watering event. Gout broke Peter Norman\u2019s 56-year-old Australian 200m record late last year when he clocked 20.04 seconds \u2013 a time faster than Bolt ran at the same age (20.13). But Kennedy caused an upset last month when he posted 20.26 to beat Gout by four tenths of a second at the Maurie Plant Meet in Melbourne. \u201cI\u2019m definitely looking forward to it. We have a great rivalry,\u201d Gout said ahead of Sunday\u2019s re-match. \u201cAnd being out here in Perth, it\u2019s a great track, so couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d Kennedy says he will definitely contest his 200m heat on Sunday, but will see how his body is feeling before deciding whether to back up for the final two hours later. In the women\u2019s 100m heats on Friday, current national record holder Torrie Lewis and Bree Rizzo both posted 11.25, while 17-year-old rising star Leah O\u2019Brien (11.31) and Mia Gross (11.33) were also quick. Three-time Olympian Peter Bol eased his way into the 800m men\u2019s semi-finals by winning his opening-round heat in 1:48.97.  -with AAP",

Gout lit up the Australian Athletics Championships in Perth on Thursday night with a wind-assisted run of 9.99 seconds in his first-round heat of the Under-20 men\u2019s category. Only runs with a 2m/s tailwind or less are considered legal, and the 3.5m/s tailwind meant Gout\u2019s first career sub 10-second run didn\u2019t officially count. Gout returned two hours later for the final and again blitzed the field with the same time of 9.99s, despite a sluggish start.  The 17-year-old raised his arms and then thumped his chest in celebration upon seeing the time, but faced a nervous wait while the official wind reading came in. Unfortunately for Gout the tailwind was 2.6m/s, meaning again his run didn\u2019t count as an official time. Gout\u2019s personal best remains 10.17 seconds. The current Australian men\u2019s record is the 9.93 seconds set by Patrick Johnson in Mito, Japan in 2003. \u201cI mean, sometimes it\u2019s frustrating, but you can\u2019t control what you can\u2019t control, and the wind is something you can\u2019t control,\u201d Gout said following his wind-assisted win in the final. \u201cI saw the clock, I saw another sub 10, I was happy \u2013 national (Under 20) champion. \u201cIt definitely boosts my confidence level (cracking 10 seconds twice in one night). \u201cSub 10 is what every sprinter hopes for, and to get this early in the season is definitely great.\u201d World Indoor 60m silver medallist Lachlan Kennedy, who boasts a personal best of 10.03 in the 100m sprint, is also aiming to crack the 10-second barrier in Perth. Kennedy, 21, is competing in the men\u2019s open field for the 100m on Friday and Saturday, meaning he won\u2019t go head-to-head with Gout over that distance this week. But the pair will lock horns on Sunday when they line up in the 200m men\u2019s event.

But Kennedy has bragging rights over the rising star after beating Gout last month in the men\u2019s 200m at the Maurie Plant Meet in Melbourne. Kennedy posted a time of 20.26 in that event, to narrowly edge Gout (20.30). \u2014AAP",

The Matildas have been without a full-time coach for eight months since Tony Gustavsson\u2019s official departure on August 1 after the Paris Olympics. In their 11th game under caretaker Tom Sermanni, Australia defeated South Korea 2-0 at Newcastle\u2019s McDonald Jones Stadium on Monday night, to claim their first back-to-back wins of the year. The South Korea friendlies are hoped to be the last under Sermanni, with FA having flagged a coach will be in place by mid-year and the Matildas\u2019 May and June friendlies against Argentina in Melbourne and Canberra. Sermanni is unsure that will be the case, as pressure mounts on FA given the ever-shortening runway to the looming 2026 Asian Cup to be hosted by Australia. Expressing relief at claiming a clean sweep of the two-match series with South Korea, Catley admitted the Matildas\u2019 rebuild had been difficult without a permanent coach. \u201cWe are at very early stages of a rebuild and that happens every cycle when you\u2019re leading into major tournaments and we\u2019ve got a year to build \u2013 well, less than a year now, but that\u2019s what it\u2019s about,\u201d Catley said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard as a playing group when you\u2019re in limbo a little bit. \u201cYou haven\u2019t got clear direction in how we\u2019re going to play moving forward. \u201cTommy\u2019s done a great job coming in. He creates an amazing culture for the girls, a real positive energy. \u201cYou can\u2019t fault him and how he\u2019s gone about it, but it is difficult when you\u2019re trying to build towards something specific and it\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve sort of had that. \u201cThe girls have been doing the absolute best that they can and we\u2019ve been sticking together and galvanising as a group. \u201cThat\u2019ll be important for us going forward.\u201d Lyon coach Joe Montemurro had emerged as a front runner for the vacant Matildas post. Catley is well-acquainted with the decorated Australian coach, having played under him at Melbourne City before following him to her current club side Arsenal.

        "raw_text": "A review is under way at a major Australian stadium where security is being beefed up after two men allegedly smuggled firearms into a packed football match. More than 82,000 fans were watching an AFL match between traditional rivals Carlton and Collingwood at the Melbourne Cricket Ground when two men were allegedly caught with guns. The weapons were discovered after the pair, who were on bail, refused a security request to leave the venue due to their behaviour. AFL chief executive Andrew Dillon has promised an \u201cend to end\u201d review into the breach and lifetime football bans for the two men. The incident is not all that surprising to Matryx security consultant Luke Percy-Dove, who said there is a prevalence of weapons in the community. \u201cIf you think about a crowd of 80,000, it probably shouldn\u2019t be that unexpected,\u201d he told AAP. The situation offering authorities an opportunity to improve security measures following the investigation, says Percy-Dove who believes it will happen again. \u201cThere\u2019s almost an assumption that when we go to major events \u2026 there will be members of the community who have weapons on them, and that will be the same everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a practical way at the moment of how it can be stopped.\u201d The MCG underwent a major security upgrade in 2024, including the rollout of sensors with artificial intelligence that can differentiate between weapons and common metals people carry. Fans should expect delays at upcoming events after the stadium blamed the incident on issues with a manual security screening. \u201cSecurity has to be cohesive, and if you\u2019ve got technology in place to detect things, it has to be reliably supported by people, processes and training to ensure security works effectively,\u201d Percy-Dove said. \u201cThe vulnerability in our industry, unfortunately, is not the technology, but the staff.\u201d AAP understands additional measures will be implemented at the ground, including increased security staff and more wanding. Hawthorn captain James Sicily, who has played at the venue twice this season, understood why the incident would shock people. \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting a kick when you\u2019re on the field,\u201d he said. \u201cBut definitely as a patron, that\u2019s very worrying and I\u2019d assume there would be some higher security checks being taken.\u201d Sydney midfielder James Rowbottom said the incident was a weird one, but he has always felt safe on game day. \u201cI\u2019m glad nothing happened, but it\u2019s obviously a pretty terrible position for someone to put the crowd and the players in as well,\u201d he told AAP. \u2014AAP",

        "raw_text": "Cricket legend Shane Warne had multiple bottles of drugs at his bedside when he was found dead in a Thai hotel room, a bombshell report alleges. The former Australian cricketerdied in March 2022 while on holiday on the Thai island of Koh Samui. The 52-year-old was found unresponsive in his rooms at the luxurious Samujana Villas just an hour after two women were seen on CCTV leaving his room. A newly unearthed medical report, revealed byThe Sunmore than three years after his death, lists two types of Viagra and a drug known to improve longevity that were found in the bedroom in his suite. The document reveals paramedics who rushed to the room discovered Sildenafil, marketed as Viagra, Kamagra, an unregulated version of Viagra available in jelly sachets, and Dapoxetine, a drug used to prevent premature ejaculation. Kamagra is illegal in Thailand, but is widely available over the counter. Viagra and Dapoxetine are legal with a prescription, but can also be bought on the black market. It remains unclear whether Warne had taken any of the drugs before his death. But the cricketer was known to have a history of heart issues, and the medications carry warnings for those with cardiovascular conditions. An autopsy conducted in Thailand concluded Warne died of natural causes due to congenital heart disease. The report ruled out foul play, according toThe Sun. But reports surfaced last weekend alleging Thai police removed Kamagra from Warne\u2019s hotel room during their investigation. This week, News Corp reported Warne had openly spoken about using Viagra during his relationship with actress and model Elizabeth Hurley. Warne was staying at the Smujana Villas resort on a holiday with three friends at the time of his death. CCTV footage from the resort showed two massage therapists leaving his villa shortly before he was found unconscious about 5pm by Andrew Neophitou, the executive producer of a documentary on Warne\u2019s life and career. \u201cThey were meant to meet some people at 5pm. Neo was next door, he\u2019s always on time,\u201d Warne\u2019s manager, James Erskine, said in 2022. \u201cHe realised [Warne] wasn\u2019t well. He tried to give mouth-to-mouth, tried to resuscitate him, he had no heartbeat.\u201d Warne\u2019s friends called for an ambulance at 5.40pm, with paramedics arriving at 6pm. The medical report details how emergency responders began CPR at 6.10pm and transported Warne to Thailand International Hospital. \u201cWhen he arrived at hospital his face was green and pale, he had black blood in his nose and mouth, which was unusual. There was no sign of life,\u201d\u00a0Dr Dulyakit Wittayachanyapong, who oversaw Warne\u2019s treatment at the hospital, toldThe Sun Online. Hospital staff attempted resuscitation for 43 minutes before Warne was declared dead at 6.53pm. The medical report states that doctors intubated him and administered adrenaline and sodium bicarbonate in efforts to revive him. Blood tests at the hospital revealed his oxygen levels had dropped to a critical 40 per cent. During his 15-year international career, Warne was widely regarded as one of cricket\u2019s greatest leg-spinners. Off the pitch, he was known for his flamboyant lifestyle. His 10-year marriage to Simone Callahan, with whom he had three children, ended in divorce. He was later engaged to Hurley, though the couple eventually separated. Warne, a habitual smoker and drinker, had also been on a liquid diet in the weeks leading up to his death. \u201cOperation shred has started (10 days in) & the goal by July is to get back to this shape from a few years ago,\u201d he wrote above a bare-chested picture of his taut, ripped younger self posted to social media on the night he arrived at Samujana Villas. -with AAP",

        "raw_text": "Jonathan Joss, a voice actor best known for his work on\u00a0 the animated TV seriesKing of the Hill, has been shot dead near his Texas home. Police found the wounded 59-year-old near the street after being dispatched to a home in south San Antonio on Sunday night (local time). He had been shot multiple times. \u201cThe officers attempted life-saving measures until EMS arrived. EMS pronounced the victim deceased,\u201d San Antonio police said. Joss\u2019 husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, confirmed the actor\u2019s death to The Associated Press in a text. The two were married earlier this year on Valentine\u2019s Day.  TMZ reports that Joss was shot by a neighbour \u2013 alleged to be 56-year-old Sigfredo Alvarez Ceja, who is now in police custody \u2013 after a disagreement. De Gonzales said he and Joss had previously faced harassment, much of it \u201copenly homophobic\u201d. He said the person who killed theParks and Recreationstar yelled \u201cviolent homophobic slurs\u201d before opening fire. \u201cHe was murdered by someone who could not stand the sight of two men loving each other,\u201d de Gonzales said. In a post on X, San Antonio police provided no further information on what prompted the shooting. They said the investigation had \u201cfound no evidence whatsoever to indicate that Mr Joss\u2019s murder was related to his sexual orientation\u201d. \u201cWe take such allegations very seriously and have thoroughly reviewed all available information. Should any new evidence come to light, we will charge the suspect accordingly,\u201d police said.  Before the shooting, de Gonzales and Joss were checking mail at Joss\u2019 home, which had been heavily damaged during a January fire that claimed the lives of their three dogs. De Gonzales said a man approached the couple and threatened them with a gun. \u201cThat home was burned down after over two years of threats from people in the area who repeatedly told us they would set it on fire. We reported these threats to law enforcement multiple times and nothing was done,\u201d he said. \u201cJonathan and I had no weapons. We were not threatening anyone. We were grieving. We were standing side by side. When the man fired Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life.\u201d After the shooting, authorities arrested 56-year-old Sigfredo Alvarez Ceja and charged him with murder in Joss\u2019 death. Joss, who grew up in San Antonio, was best known as the voice of John Redcorn, a Native American character on the popularKing of the Hillanimated series that ran for 13 seasons from 1997 to 2008. A reboot of the show is set to start in August. Joss also had a recurring role as Chief Ken Hotate on TV\u2019sParks and Recreation. He appeared in two episodes of the seriesTulsa Kingin 2022. Before he was fatally shot, Joss had been in Austin, about 130 kilometres north-east of San Antonio, for events related to a sneak peak of theKing of the Hillrevival. On Saturday, Joss had posted a video on Instagram in which he said he was signing autographs at a comic book store in Austin. \u201cThe fans get to revisitKing of the Hillagain, which I think is an amazing thing because it\u2019s a great show,\u201d he said in the video, adding he had already done voice work on four episodes of the revival. De Gonzales said Joss was grateful for his fans. \u201cTo everyone who supported him, his fans, his friends, know that he valued you deeply. He saw you as family,\u201d he said. -with AAP",

        "raw_text": "When winter festival Dark Mofo was put on ice, artistic director Chris Twite was understandably nervous about what people would think. But ticket sales for the revived 2025 edition, which kicks off in Hobart on Thursday, appear on track to surpass records. Dark Mofo ran at reduced capacity last year so organisers could take stock financially in an environment in which many events were struggling or pulling the pin. \u201cIt was a really hard decision \u2026 but ultimately it was the right one to make. It is going pay to dividends for the next decade,\u201d Twite said on Monday. \u201cWe were really worried that people would rightly miss the festival or be upset. \u201cBut by and large the reaction has been really great from people because they understood we were trying to build a foundation.\u201d The most recent full-bore Dark Mofo in 2023 cost about 55 per cent more than the similarly sized 2019 iteration, Twite said. There was a lot of \u201cboring\u201d work to get the books in better shape, while continued state government funding of $21.6 million to 2027 played its part. Twite said Dark Mofo would never run at a profit, noting that MONA gallery owner David Walsh had contributed $30 million over a decade. The festival has proven a massive boost for tourism in Tasmania\u2019s off-season since launching in 2013, and has often courted controversy. Upside-down Christian crosses have featured on Hobart\u2019s waterfront, while in 2021 it was forced to pull the pin on a piece after criticism over a lack of consultation. Spain\u2019s Santiago Sierra had planned to immerse a Union Jack flag in the donated blood of Indigenous people as a statement against colonialism. The festival apologised and pledged to work more closely with Indigenous artists. Twite, who took over from inaugural artistic director Leigh Carmichael in 2023, said Dark Mofo would continue to push the envelope but was cognisant of its responsibilities. He pointed to work by Indigenous Alaskan artist Nicholas Galanin, who has created a space for people to \u201cscream as long as they want\u201d about whatever they want. \u201cAt the heart of the festival is presenting confrontational work that challenges ideas,\u201d Twite said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve changed ever from that. I think the way we do that changes year in, year out.\u201d The decision to still hold the winter feast and popular nude solstice swim in 2024 was important so Dark Mofo didn\u2019t disappear off the radar entirely, Twite said. Ticket sales were on track to match or beat the 100,000 mark set in 2023, he said. -AAP",

        "raw_text": "Melania Trump\u2019s decision to use an AI-generated version of herself to narrate her memoir has been slammed online, with many questioning whether she actually wrote the book. The US first lady described using AI for the audiobook of her self-titled autobiography,Melania: A Memoir, as \u201cthe future of publishing\u201d when she announced the move on X last week. \u201cI am honoured to bring youMelania \u2013 The AI Audiobook\u2013 narrated entirely using artificial intelligence in my own voice,\u201d Melania wrote in a post on X, along with a futuristic video. \u201cLet the future of publishing begin.\u201d But the assessment from many social media users was less than positive. \u201cAn AI Melania reading Melania\u2019s memoir? That\u2019s a disconnection wrapped in digital cosplay,\u201d posted Wall Street investment bankerEvaristus Odinikaeze. \u201cWho really believes that Melania can write a book, let alone read it?\u201d he added.  \u201cWell, considering she probablydidn\u2019t write it herself,it makes sense she doesn\u2019t want to read it!\u201d said another. The posts follow discussions last year on forums including Reddit about whether Melania used ChatGTP, or a similar AI program, to write her book. \u201cOveruse of participle clauses really sets my AI Geiger counter crackling these days,\u201d one Reddit user, who is also a teacher, commented shortly after the text version of the book was released. \u201cInstant red flag when I read student work and they\u2019ve never used a comma correctly with pen and paper in class, but suddenly their essays and stories (typed up at home) are full of \u2018This happened, causing this in turn\u2019 or \u2018I felt this, leading me to act like that\u2019,\u201d he added. The 182-page written version of the 55-year-old\u2019s memoir was published in October last year, a day before the US election that returned her husband Donald to the White House for a second presidential term. It tells the story of her youth in Slovenia and her journey into the world of high fashion, as well as her meeting with, and marriage to, Trump. Melania also shared \u201cstories and images never before shared with the public\u201d from her early years, home life and time in the White House as first lady. The book received a lukewarm reception at the time.The New York Timesdescribed it asa \u201cbrazen whitewash of a presidency\u2026 slim and full of obfuscations\u201d. \u201cMelania Trump\u2019s new memoir offers a few new glimpses into a life she has carefully walled off from the public, but readers hoping to understand one of the most mysterious first ladies in modern history will not make it past the gilded front gate,\u201d wrote White House correspondent, Katie Rogers. While the normal hardcover version of the book went on sale for US$40 ($62), a \u201ccollector\u2019s edition\u201d was released soon after with a whopping price tag of US$250 ($387). Signed by Melania, the deluxe version of the book includes a \u201cdigital collectible\u201d and pictures \u2013 including one of her and Donald Trump on their first date and others she captured while her husband was in office. \u201cHa Ha Ha \u2013 The grift never ends.

        "raw_text": "As we head into a new month of streaming, here\u2019s a fresh wave of TV ready to challenge, transport and entertain you. This month\u2019s picks span genre and geography, from an eerie dystopian Buenos Aires, to a witty, awkward cyborg hero. Reality TV also gets a scandalous twist with the return ofThe Secret Lives of Mormon Wives. AndDeaf President Now!delivers a powerful documentary on a historical milestone for Deaf rights. There\u2019s something for every kind of viewer \u2014 and every kind of mood. Netflix Argentine sci-fiThe Eternautopens with a group of old friends in Buenos Aires meeting to play the card game truco on a hot summer night \u2013 when things suddenly get eerie. The power goes out and a poisonous snowfall starts to blanket the city, killing thousands of people instantly. The survivors must get answers, quickly, as they start to grasp the true strength of their invisible enemy. Based on H\u00e9ctor Germ\u00e1n Oesterheld\u2019s 1950s comic of the same name,The Eternautportrays apocalypse through a deeply local and political lens \u2013 and in doing so has struck a chord in Argentina. Directed by Bruno Stagnaro and led by Argentine film icon Ricardo Dar\u00edn, as protagonist Juan Salvo, the series emphasises the power of collective heroism, and subtly critiques the current government\u2019s uncompromising neoliberal approach. It also pulses with national pride. Buenos Aires is not glamorised; real neighbourhoods are shown as classic Argentine tango, rock and folk plays in the background. Most importantly, Argentine identity is celebrated through themes of community spirit, grassroots resistance, and ingenuity in times of crisis. The Eternautfeels both timely and timeless. Its slogan, \u201cno one survives alone,\u201d resonates for a country that has been long marked by both trauma and resistance efforts. Its emotional weight is further deepened by Oesterheld\u2019s legacy, including the tragic disappearance of him and his family members under the military rule of the 1970s. With a second season on the way, this series is a powerful ode to Argentina. \u2013 Claudia Sandberg Apple TV+ Murderbot, Apple\u2019s adaptation of Martha Wells\u2019 science-fiction novellaAll Systems Red(2017) is a satisfying combination of action, sci-fi and comedy. The show centres on a security unit (SecUnit) \u2013 an indentured private security cyborg \u2013 who secretly cracks the programming of its governing chip, granting itself autonomy. Murderbot (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd), as it dubs itself, is both horrified and fascinated by humans. It\u2019s far more afraid of eye contact, emotions and direct conversation than any physical danger. It\u2019s also obsessed with mainlining media, particularly the ridiculous soap operaThe Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon. Murderbot is hired, reluctantly, by some hippy scientists from a group of \u201cfreehold\u201d planets \u2013 ones that exist outside the Corporation Rim \u2013 to act as protection on a scientific expedition. It goes quickly awry. Wells\u2019 award-winning novella, the first in an equally good series, limits us to the first-person perspective of the sarcastic cyborg. The series expands this frame beautifully, building on the source material\u2019s dry humour to create a world that is both goofy and grounded. And while there are serious themes at play, such as the way SecUnits are effectively enslaved, and the violent capitalist dominance of the Corporation Rim, the show is not heavy. Skarsg\u00e5rd offers a pitch-perfect performance of the awkward, anxious robot \u2013 its eyes flickering in horror as the scientists try to befriend it. The opening minutes of the first episode are clumsy and on-the-nose, but ignore them. This otherwise well-designed and well-directed show cracks along with brisk, highly-entertaining 22-minute episodes. \u2013 Erin Harrington Disney+ Season one ofThe Secret Lives of Mormon Wiveshad us hooked at the end of 2024. Now, the women have returned for an explosive 10-episode second season. The reality series follows a group of Mormon women living in Utah. While the title may have you anticipating stories of faith and motherhood, the show is more focused on the personal lives of Mormon mothers who rose to TikTok fame due to scandal and infamy. Season one had the women grapple with balancing traditional Mormon values with their online lives and subsequent businesses (along with the fallout from a \u201csoft-swinging scandal\u201d). Season two further highlights infidelity, jealously and money. Old characters are brought back, with finger-pointing ex-husbands and former alienated friends adding to the fray. Police are called, insults are thrown and many of the women delve deeper into their pasts. The show flips flops between difficult moments such as processing the death of loved ones and difficult pregnancies, with parties and poorly executed party games. At one point the women play pregnancy roulette (a game no one should recommend), and take pregnancy tests that are anonymously read out to the group. Chaos ensues. And after watching, you can search for the TikTok accounts of the stars and watch new drama unfold in real-time \u2013 or watch them \u201ccorrect\u201d and expand on past situations based on their own perspectives \u2013 far removed from show\u2019s editors. \u2013 Edith Jennifer Hill Apple TV+ Deaf President Now!is a stirring documentary about an iconic student uprising at Gallaudet University, the world\u2019s only deaf university, in 1988. The film chronicles how deaf students \u2013 tired of being led by hearing leadership \u2013 decided to take things in their own hands come the 1988 Gallaudet presidential election. With two of the three candidates being deaf, the appointment of Elisabeth Zinser, a hearing candidate unfamiliar with deaf culture, sparked outrage. Fuelled by decades of marginalisation, the students barricaded campus gates, burned effigies of Zinser and marched to the Capitol, calling for deaf leadership in deaf spaces. It worked. The protest forced Zinser\u2019s resignation and ushered in Irving King Jordan, Gallaudet\u2019s first deaf president. The film juxtaposes historic footage with present-day interviews with key leaders of the movement, allowing them to tell their stories their own way. These reflections, delivered in American Sign Language, underscore how storytelling itself can become an act of resistance for deaf people. At the same time, the documentary wrestles with a paradox. Co-directed by deaf activist Nyle DiMarco and hearing filmmaker Davis Guggenheim, the film exemplifies how deaf storytelling still often has hearing involvement, especially when the story is packaged for a mainstream audience. Nevertheless, the release ofDeaf President Now!couldn\u2019t have been more timely. With disability rights in the US threatened under Trump, the film is a call to action. It reminds us deaf culture isn\u2019t just about language: it\u2019s about pride, self-determination and visibility. \u2013 Gemma King, Samuel Martin and Sofya Gollan  Stan, from June 15 In Lorcan Finnegan\u2019sThe Surfer,our unnamed protagonist (Nicolas Cage) returns to his former Australian home from the US. He is newly divorced, and trying to buy a beachside property to win back his family. He takes his teenage son (Finn Little) for a surf near the property, but they are run off by an unfriendly pack of locals. Returning alone to the beachside car park to make some calls, he is besieged there by the same gang, and this continues over the next several days. The gang is led by a terrifying middle-aged Andrew Tate-esque influencer, Scally (Julian McMahon), who runs the beach like a combination of a frat bro party and wellness retreat. It is impossible to think of an actor other than Cage who could make a character like this so enjoyable to watch. Cage\u2019s distinctively American confidence has no resistance to the terrifying switches of Australian masculinity from friendly to teasing to violent. The Surferis an absolute blast. A lot of the fun is in anticipating each dreadful humiliation \u2013 and it somehow turning out worse than you could have expected. The Surferbeautifully captures the natural surroundings, stunning views and shimmering heat of Australian coastal summer. At the same time, a confined, semi-urban feature like a beachside car park feels bleak and uninviting. As a film setting, it is both a spectacular wide-open vista and stiflingly claustrophobic \u2013 a perfect mechanism for The Surfer\u2019s psychological horror. \u2013Grace Russell Netflix The story of serial killers,Fred and Rose West, has been highly narrativised since their shocking crimes were discovered in Gloucester in 1994. The horror of the Wests lies in the juxtaposition of their seemingly ordinary suburban family and what was hidden beneath the foundations of their home. Fred and Rose West: A British Horror Storytakes us back to the moment of that revelation via previously unheard interview tapes and recordings of the property search \u2013 and of Rose while she was kept in a safe house. Family home videos add to the disturbing sense of the couple\u2019s duplicity. Interviews with the family of some of the victims emphasise the ongoing pain caused by the Wests, who preyed on vulnerable young women. Meanwhile, Fred\u2019s interviews reinforce his determination to protect his wife: \u201cI trained Rose to do what I wanted. That is why our marriage worked out so well.\u201d Many details of the Wests\u2019 true horror, however, are absent: the incredible torture suffered by the victims; Fred and Rose\u2019s own childhoods of abuse and Fred\u2019s earlier assault of young girls, including his own sister; and any reference to the couple\u2019s surviving children and the extraordinary abuse they suffered. The horror of this documentary is present in the couple\u2019s habitual lies, their casual attitude to violence and murder, and their refusal to take responsibility for their many crimes. Yet it only scratches the surface of the Wests\u2019 true horror story. \u2013 Jessica Gildersleeve Netflix The Four Seasonsfollows three 50-something affluent couples as they holiday together over the course of a year. Friends since college, the group\u2019s easy camaraderie is upended by Nick\u2019s (Steve Carroll) bombshell decision to leave his seemingly unsuspecting wife, Anne (Kerri Kenney-Silver), after 25 years of marriage. The announcement sends shockwaves through the other couples, testing their own relationships. Adapted from Alan Alda\u2019s bittersweet 1981comedyof the same name, the series preserves the film\u2019s narrative conceit, unfolding over four seasonal mini trips. Episode one opens in full spring at Nick and Anne\u2019s bucolic lake house. Given the luxury on display, you\u2019d be forgiven for mistakingThe Four Seasonsas another entry in the \u201crich-people-behaving-badly\u201d genre. But while there\u2019s plenty of quips and snarky humour, what unfolds is ultimately much kinder \u2013 less a scathing indictment of wealth and more a gentle exploration of the banalities of love and middle age. The show\u2019s creators make the most of the expanded running time to humanise the sextet. The open marriage between gregarious Italian Claude (Marco Calvini) and husband Danny (a marvellous Colman Domingo) updates the source material without sliding into tokenism or homonormativity. The prickly Type-A Kate (Tina Fey) and peacekeeper Jack (Will Forte) provide the series\u2019 beating heart, in a relationship that feels lived-in and familiar. Despite its focus on ageing, loss, mortality and grief, The Four Seasons offers comfort viewing at its finest, best enjoyed with a cup of tea and a loved one who\u2019s known you for decades. \u2013 Rachel Williamson Claudia Sandberg, Senior Lecturer, Technology in Culture and Society,The University of Melbourne;Edith Jennifer Hill, Associate Lecturer, Learning & Teaching Innovation,Flinders University;Erin Harrington, Senior Lecturer in English and Cultural Studies,University of Canterbury;Gemma King, ARC DECRA Fellow in Screen Studies, Senior Lecturer in French Studies,Australian National University;Grace Russell, Lecturer, Arts and Humanities,Monash University;Jessica Gildersleeve, Professor of English Literature,University of Southern Queensland;Rachel Williamson, Senior Tutor in English,University of Canterbury;Samuel Martin, Researcher, Sign on Screen Project,Australian National University, andSofya Gollan, PhD Candidate, Sign On Screen Project,Australian National University This article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

        "raw_text": "When Australian New Wave movies burst on to world cinema screens in the 1970s, sceptical audiences were initially baffled by the broad accents and peculiar colloquialisms. Sunday Too Far Away, an iconic tale about male culture and loyalty in a 1950s shearing shed, was the first big hit of Australia\u2019s golden era of cinema but Americans were especially mystified by it, producer Matt Carroll remembers. \u201cThey recognised thatSundaywas a great film but they didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was pretty incomprehensible to anyone who wasn\u2019t an Australian. At American screenings, you might as well have had it in Dutch.\u201d French audiences were far more welcoming of the film at Cannes directors\u2019 fortnight, thanks to the wife of an Adelaide car dealer who\u2019d sold Carroll a Peugeot. \u201cShe said, \u2018oh yes darling, I know Parisian street slang, I\u2019ll translate it all for you [into subtitles]\u2019,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cI remember sitting in the cinema and the first thing that comes up is somebody in the shearing shed says about the squatter, \u2018his s\u2013t doesn\u2019t stink\u2019. When it was translated, the Parisian slang for that is \u2018he farts above his a\u2013ehole\u2019.\u201d In the huge screening room, \u201cthe whole audience just went crazy, absolutely crazy, and we got a huge sale to France\u201d, Carroll said. Legendary Australian actor Jack Thompson \u2013 who portrayed the hard-drinking gun shearer, Foley \u2013 says \u201cit\u2019s the language of the bush\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a wonderful camaraderie expressed in that movie.Sundaysays something much more profound about the Australian character than a number of other movies that examined our victories and failures,\u201d he said. Thompson, who left home at 14 to work as a jackaroo in the Northern Territory, said the film \u201cwas like a diary, it was just how people behaved \u2013 I remember, because as a teenager, I was in those sheds\u201d. \u201cSunday Too Far Awayhas a really important part in my career and in my memory; I\u2019d worked on that wool press, I\u2019d picked up that wool. I knew how tough it was \u2026 it was the world of working men.\u201d Thompson starred in a slew of other New Wave movies, includingBreaker Morant, Mad Dog Morgan, The ClubandThe Man From Snowy River. Carroll recalls also feeling well qualified to be involved inSunday Too Far Away, which was filmed at Carriewerloo Station, near Port Augusta, and Quorn. \u201cI grew up on a sheep property so I learned how to class wool. My honours thesis was in Australian shearing sheds. So when we needed to find a shearing shed, I knew exactly where they were,\u201d he says. \u201cJack and I were sharing a house together, and I knew that he was a shearer, and I was there when the director said, \u2018I don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to find shearers from\u2019. And I said, \u2018Well, I know\u2019. Thompson and Carroll recently visited Adelaide for a 50th anniversary screening ofSunday Too Far Away, staged by SA Film Corporation, which played a key role in the era. \u201cThe SAFC was an important beacon in the growth of the Australian film industry,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cTale after tale important to our understanding of ourselves was told and financed by that entity.\u201d The New York Timesdescribed Australian New Wave as \u201ccapturing a moment of freedom and abundance that was over almost before we knew it\u201d and \u201cpossessing a vitality, a love of open space and a propensity for sudden violence and languorous sexuality\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d said Thompson, now aged 84, deadpan. \u201cUsed to be, mate,\u201d said Carroll, 80. As a young actor, it was like \u201criding the crest of a wave, it was stunning\u201d, said Thompson. \u201cThere was indeed a very focused vitality, a unique charm, unlike anything else at the time.\u201d Carroll, who also producedBreaker MorantandStorm Boyfor SAFC, said the 1970s was a remarkable period for Australian movies. \u201cMore than 220 films, that\u2019s more than 20 films a year. And when you read the titles, it\u2019s just staggering,\u201d he said. \u201cWe never had another period like that, with the inventiveness and the creativity.\u201d The SAFC\u2019s second feature, the enigmatic and menacingPicnic at Hanging Rock,which also turns 50 this year, became an icon of Australian cinema. \u201cThe great thing that happened after that is that Margaret Fink madeMy Brilliant Career, and the Americans understood it,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cThenBreaker Morantcame along and they clicked with it and it had huge results, and then the secondMad Maxwas a giant hit. So those three films were key to opening up the American market.\u201d Thompson noted that Australia made the world\u2019s first feature-length narrative movie,The Story of the Kelly Gang,in 1906, \u201cand we had a vital Australian film industry in the silent era up to 1927\u201d. \u201cHollywood and the American investment in theatre chains here was able to dominate the Australian film industry, and essentially, between 1930 and the 70s, nothing much happened in Australian cinema,\u201d he said. WhileSunday Too Far Awaywas New Wave\u2019s first commercial success, 1971\u2019sWake In Frightis widely regarded as the era\u2019s opening film. It was Thompson\u2019s first movie and the last for veteran character actor Chips Rafferty, who died of a heart attack before it was released. It also screened at Cannes and had favourable responses in France. It did well in the UK but struggled at the Australian box office. It\u2019s the story of a teacher waylaid in a mining town where a gambling spree leaves him broke. Amid a haze of alcohol, he participates in a gruesome kangaroo hunt and is also subjected to moral degradation. It ran for just 10 days in Sydney, and 14 in Melbourne, Thompson recalled, \u201cand people were saying \u2018that\u2019s not us\u2019, despite the fact the book was written by an Australian\u201d. \u201cBecause when we were seen on screen [previously], we were seen as these pleasant caricatures. We weren\u2019t used to seeing it and we didn\u2019t want to see it,\u201d he said. During an early Australian screening, when a man stood up, pointed at the screen and protested \u201cthat\u2019s not us!\u201d, Thompson famously yelled back \u201csit down, mate. It is us\u201d. -AAP",

        "raw_text": "Billie Piper has replaced Ncuti Gatwa as the Doctor, with the character regenerating during the finale of the science-fiction series Doctor Who. Piper, 42, first appeared in the series as the companion to the ninth Doctor in 2005, playing Rose Tyler alongside Christopher Eccleston\u2019s Time Lord \u2013 and then again for the 10th Doctor played by David Tennant. Piper appears to replace Gatwa, who leaves Doctor Who after two seasons in the science-fiction series. She will now be the second woman to take on the role as the Time Lord after Jodie Whittaker portrayed the 13th doctor. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret how much I love this show, and I have always said I would love to return to the Whoniverse as I have some of my best memories there, so to be given the opportunity to step back on that Tardis one more time was just something I couldn\u2019t refuse, but who, how, why and when, you\u2019ll just have to wait and see,\u201d she said. Sex Education and Barbie star Gatwa has played the 15th Doctor since Scottish actor David Tennant bi-generated in 2023, after his version of the character was brought back to life as the 14th Doctor. Born in Rwanda before moving to Scotland, the Gatwa\u2019s time on the long-running science fiction programme came to an end as The Reality War episode brought this season to a close on Saturday. \u201cThis journey has been one that I will never forget, and a role that will be part of me forever. There are no words to describe what it feels like to be cast as the Doctor, nor are there words to explain what it feels like to be accepted into this iconic role that has existed for over 60 years and is truly loved by so many across the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve loved every minute of it, but now is the time to hand over the keys to that beloved blue box and let someone else take control and enjoy it every bit as much as I have. I\u2019ll truly miss it, and forever be grateful to it, and everyone that has played a part in my journey as the Doctor.\u201d The two-part season finale saw the Doctor face the Rani in a battle to save the world after making the decision to safe the life of one little girl. As he bid farewell to companion Belinda Chandra, played by Varada Sethu, he said: \u201cI hope you\u2019ll see me again, but not like this\u201d. Piper shot to fame in 1998 at the age of 15 with the release of her debut pop single Because We Want To. The chart topper was followed by another number one single, Girlfriend, and her platinum-selling debut album Honey To The B. But she then moved into acting, later saying it was what she wanted to do most, and her breakthrough role came as the companion to Doctor Who in 2005. She later starred in the ITV series Secret Diary Of A Call Girl from 2007 to 2011, playing an escort in London. She made her directorial debut in 2019 with Rare Beasts, a dark comedy drama she also wrote and starred in. Last year, she portrayed Newsnight producer Sam McAlister in Netflix\u2019s Scoop, which tells the behind-the-scenes story of Emily Maitlis\u2019s momentous interview with the Duke of York. Piper\u2019s performance earned her a nomination for Best Leading Actress at the 2025 Bafta TV Awards. \u2014AAP",

        "raw_text": "Australia\u2019s Philippou brothers are in the grip of nerves over the release this week into Australian cinemas ofBring Her Back, their follow-up to the horror gem,Talk to Me. The identical twins \u2014 Danny, the blonde one who writes and directs, and Michael who directs and does post-production \u2014 have yet to find the courage to sit through a screening with an audience. The brothers, who grew up in the Adelaide suburb of Pooraka, like what they\u2019ve done, but are not ready to find out what audiences think. They probably shouldn\u2019t worry.Bring Her Back\u2019sUS release has already drawn headlines including \u2018The Philippous are Two for Two\u2019and\u2018Best Horror Movie of 2025 So Far\u2019,and debuted on Rotten Tomatoes with a 95 per cent approval rating. The general conclusion in the American media is the boys have another hit on their hands. After the phenomenal success ofTalk to Me, which cost less than $5 million to make and earned $140 million worldwide, the Philippous now have a reputation to protect. When they made their first film \u2013 released in 2023 and picked up by the Sundance Film Festival \u2013 they were cinematic unknowns coming off success as YouTubers with theirJackass-style prankster channel,RackaRacka. This time they had studio backing from indie international studio A24, a larger budget, bigger crew, and a special effects department able to implement their wildest fantasies. \u201cThe only thing that changed for us was more pressure and the weight of expectations,\u201d Danny said. \u201cThat was a little bit paralysing and I could feel my feet getting cemented to the ground from overthinking it,\u201d he added. Bring Her Back, written by Danny withTalk to Meco-writer Bill Hinzman, is set in the same paranormal playground of summoning the dead. \u201cWe didn\u2019t feel as though we had finished exploring those themes or that the story was completely told yet,\u201d Danny said. But this movie is darker and grislier thanTalk to Me,which took place among a group of high-spirited students in their house-party era. Bring Her Backis a character-driven tale of a woman enduring the loss of a child whose grief descends into ritualistic violence. Their starting point for the script was the partially-sighted sister of a friend who wanted to navigate the world with independence in spite of her disability. In the film, Piper (Sora Wong) is a nearly blind teenager whose brother Andy (British actor Billy Barratt) plans to become her guardian as soon as he turns 18. Until then, they are fostered with Laura (Sally Hawkins) who has lost a daughter and gained a mysterious foster child, a mute boy called Oliver (Jonah Wren Phillips). The brothers felt that casting Piper with a partially-sighted actor was important to the film\u2019s integrity and Wong, who had never acted, flourished in the role as shooting progressed. \u201cIt is such a rare thing to see on screen; usually, you have these normal people acting with contact lenses in but we wanted to portray it properly,\u201d Danny says. \u201cSora came in and she just had it.\u201d Wong was a Sydney schoolgirl whose mother saw an ad on Facebook when she auditioned, but\u00a0was able to\u00a0improvise and\u00a0channel a character without any training. \u201cShe was able to feel that and portray that, so it was the most amazing thing to watch \u2014 \u2018you\u2019re an actor, you\u2019ve got it\u2019,\u201d Michael said. \u201cIt was about nurturing that and making her comfortable and able to express herself as we worked up to those bigger scenes. It was the most amazing thing ever.\u201d Their biggest coup was to cast Hollywood actor and double Oscar nominee Sally Hawkins, their first choice for the role on the strength of her powerful performances in films likeBlue Jasmine, with Cate Blanchett, andThe Shape of Water, Guillermo del Toro\u2019s\u00a0dark fantasy about a woman who falls in love with an amphibious monster. They were astonished when Hawkins, fresh from twoPaddingtonfilms, said yes. Her off-kilter performance as a woman obsessed drives the film. \u201cDanny and Michael will storm the world,\u201d Hawkins said after filming with them. \u201cI felt completely supported and trusted and given the space to do what I needed to do.\u201d Michael said he could not believe she wanted to work with, as he puts it,\u2018two bogans from Pooraka\u2019. Hawkins\u2019 portrayal of a woman who presents as a bubbly Adelaide Hills psychologist with a libertarian approach to foster care is the mainstay of the film,and her trust in the Philippous says much about their appeal, and their filmmaking future. On screen she embodies, with a stripped back Australian accent, a woman who loses her bearings and descends into darkness. \u201cWe had these amazing conversations and got on like a house on fire \u2013 it is one of the best experiences I have had working with anybody,\u201d Danny said. \u201cShe is always Sally but underneath that is the whole weight of the character. She would go shopping as the character when she was off screen.\u201d The other star of the film is the spectacular special effects, which take blood and gore to extreme and horrifying lengths. Whereas the boys would once experiment with fake blood in their bedrooms, they now have an entire department to play with. The result delivers moments of screen time so ghastly it is hard to think anyone but the Philippous would even try. The decision to shoot again in Adelaide was this time less to do with staying in their comfort zone and more a matter of seizing on opportunities and a desire to bring as much as they can back to Adelaide. Most of the action takes place in a remote house set among the woods and it was filmed at Brownhill Creek, close to town in the Adelaide Hills. Importantly, it had a swimming pool visible from every window,which becomes a focus as the grisly drama unfolds. Everywhere the grieving Laura looks, she is reminded of her daughter\u2019s loss. Despite their newfound Hollywood standing, the Philippous will not be departing for Los Angeles any time soon. Talk to Meattracted admiration from Hollywood heavyweights including Steven Spielberg, Benicio del Toro, Ari Aster and Jordan Peele, and a move overseas would seem likely. But the twins, now 32, have bought a house in Adelaide and to further cement their connection to home. They have also partnered as producers with Kristina Ceyton and Samantha Jennings from Causeway Films in a new production house, Rackaway, which has an office in the Glenside film hub. \u201cIt always feels good coming home, even if we\u2019ve gone for a week or a year,\u201d Danny says. \u201cWhen I come home, I feel safe and supported and I can\u2019t see myself moving out of Adelaide any time soon.\u201d Their exploration of horrors beyond the grave is now complete and they have launched into something completely different, stretching themselves again to work beyond what they know. They are making a documentary about the underground cult sport of death-match wrestling\u2014an extreme, brutal, no-holds-barred style of ring combat that is dangerous, offers no money, and which Michael, who trained as a stunt man, engages in. They have\u00a0already begun\u00a0in Japan, Mexico, and the\u00a0United States,\u00a0US\u00a0with\u00a0Michael\u00a0stepping into the ring\u00a0with the film\u2019s stars. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing it since we were kids,\u201d Michael says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very extreme style of professional wrestling. It\u2019s story-telling but with real barbed wire, real thumb tacks, real blood. We are following people who do that and are finding out what drives them to do it.\u201d Bring Her Backis in cinemas now.",

        "raw_text": "A new Covid-19 strain is fast spreading throughout Australia with doctors again urging people to access booster vaccinations. The Covid strain NB.1.8.1 has been designated by the World Health Organisation as a \u201cvariant under monitoring\u201d. NB.1.8.1 currently makes up more than 40 per cent of all total Covid cases tested in Victoria, about 25 per cent in Western Australia and NSW, 20 per cent in Queensland and less than 10 per cent in South Australia. \u201cThe new strain is now the dominant coronavirus strain in China and Hong Kong and, in Australia, we\u2019re seeing it pretty much everywhere,\u201dGriffith University virologist Associate Professor Lara Herrero said. Herrato told the ABC the strain was predicted to become the dominant Covid varient in Australia too. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of cases in the community coming through the [emergency department] but it\u2019s likely we\u2019re heavily under-reporting because Covid reporting is no longer mandatory,\u201d \u00a0she said. The task of trackingNB.1.8.1 and its impact ismore difficult than in the days of the pandemic as fewer people are testing and reporting infections. So what do we need to know about this fast-spreading Covid variant? According to the WHO, NB.1.8.1 was first detected in samplescollected in January 2025. It\u2019s a \u2018sublineage\u2019 of the Omicron variant, and is thought to be a strain arising from the genetic mixing of two or more existing variants. Herraro said while not much data was available yet for this variant, arecent preprint(a study that has not yet been peer reviewed) offered clues about why NB.1.8.1 may be gathering traction. \u201cUsing lab-based models, researchers found NB.1.8.1 had the strongest binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor of several variants tested \u2013 suggesting it may infect cells more efficiently than earlier strains,\u201d she said. The study also found that it was possible a person infected with NB.1.8.1 may be more likely to pass the virus on to someone else, compared to earlier variants. The good news is that while it may spread faster and more easily within the community, the WHO has not yet observed any evidence it causesmore severe diseasecompared to other variants. \u201cReports suggestsymptoms of NB.1.8.1should align closely with other Omicron subvariants,\u201d Herrara said.. Common symptoms include sore throat, fatigue, fever, mild cough, muscle aches and nasal congestion. Some people may also have gastrointestinal symptoms. Herrero said the most recent booster available in Australia and many other countries targeted the JN.1 varient, from which NB.1.8.1 was descended. \u201cSo it makes sense it should still offer good protection,\u201d she said. Unfortunately only 6.6 per cent of adults have received a Covid vaccine in the past six months, according to federal data. Health Minister Mark Butler has encouraged Australians to get the Covid booster as winter officially begins \u201cI do encourage, particularly as we head into winter, for people to think about the last time they got a Covid vaccine,\u201dButler said. \u201cOlder Australians are strongly encouraged and recommended to get that booster. But certainly everyone else is eligible for a free Covid booster, if they\u2019ve not had one in the last 12 months at their local pharmacy or GP.\u201d Australian Medical Association NSW chair of public health Dr Michael Bonning saidrespiratory infections were generally up nationally. \u201cWe are expecting a spike in cases over the coming weeks with an expectation of a particularly difficult winter respiratory season because of what we have seen in the northern hemisphere,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cIn NSW in the past week there was an increase of 29.2 per cent in Covid-19 notifications, an increase of 25.9 per cent in influenza notifications, and an increase of 9.7 per cent in RSV notifications,\u201d Bonning said.",

        "raw_text": "As someone attuned to the distinct styles ofauteur filmmakers, I came to Wes Anderson\u2019s latest offeringThe Phoenician Schemeintrigued, feeling a mix of distance and familiarity. My appreciation for other auteur directors like Stanley Kubrick, Spike Lee and Alfred Hitchcock may have sometimes inadvertently pushed Anderson\u2019s work to the periphery of my viewing habits, butThe Phoenician Scheme(his 13th directorial film) provides an opportunity to reassess that omission. The cinematic trademarks were all there: deadpan performances, meticulous symmetry,whip-pan camera work(when the camera whips round so fast, everything blurs), ice-cream colour palettes and trains, frequently present in some form throughout Anderson\u2019sfilmography. And a Bill Murray cameo? Of course \u2013 along with other minor roles from Tom Hanks, Bryan Cranston, Scarlett Johansson, Richard Ayoade, Riz Ahmed and Benedict Cumberbatch (as well as many others), all appearing briefly across the film\u2019s brisk 90-minute runtime \u2013 a fairly typical length for an Anderson feature. Although I foundThe Phoenician Schemea fairly enjoyable film and one that ardent fans will surely embrace, my issue was perhaps precisely within the formulaic nature of this work. This sense of familiarity makes the viewing simultaneously comfortable, but also a little predictable. Aside from a genuinely unexpected explosion in the film\u2019s opening moments, there was little that caught me off guard, making it difficult to gauge just how memorableThe Phoenician Schemewill be in the long run. It entertains but rarely surprises and despite the litany of cameos, each one is fairly unmemorable. In fact, while writing this, I\u2019ve only just remembered that Willem Dafoe is in a scene or two as well. It\u2019s not that anyone is necessarily giving a bad performance but rather each iteration of wry whimsy results in a kind of stylistic uniformity that renders them indistinct from one another. By contrast, the film\u2019s three leading roles benefit from sustained screen time, allowing for a little more nuance. Benicio del Toro leads the cast as Zsa-Zsa Korda, a rich and morally ambiguous industrialist, set within the fictional Middle Eastern nation of Phoenicia during the 1950s. Korda is on the point of political and personal ruin. His life is constantly in danger with ongoing visual and verbal gags from the beginning about his nonchalance towards assassination. Korda faces execution threats from shadowy agencies and members of his own board to the extent that his suspiciousness has become a comfortable characteristic. Newcomer Mia Threapleton (daughter of Kate Winslet) stars as Liesl Korda, his estranged daughter who has spent years in quiet devotion as a nun in a remote convent. Her sudden appointment as her father\u2019s heir thrusts her back into a world she had long abandoned, continuing Anderson\u2019s other fascination with fractured, complex familial dynamics, as the rest of her siblings look on. Michael Cera portrays Bjorn Lund, a docile yet quietly astute tutor with a fascination for insects, who is brought in to help Liesl adjust to her new responsibilities. Without revealing too much, Lund turns out to be more than he initially seems, giving Cera the chance to slip back into that awkward, mock-cool persona \u2013reminiscent of hisTwin Peaks: The Returnrole, in which he channels a Marlon Brando-style rebel straight out ofThe Wild One. In typical Anderson style, visual gags (here in the form of props) propel the film along, from Lund\u2019s bugs to Liesl\u2019s jewel-encrusted rosary and Korda\u2019s weapons, which include grenades that he politely offers to other diplomats as a formal greeting. The visually rich and symmetrical arrangement of characters, against a static or sideways moving camera reminded me of how much Anderson is inspired byPeter Greenaway\u2019swork, particularlyThe Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover(1989). Anderson draws on this auteur aesthetically and thematically but also through absurdity. While Greenaway\u2019s films take inspiration from canvas painting, the closing credit sequence ofThe Phoenician Schemealso features well known artworks, serving as inspiration for the content. The visuals, which are rich throughout, are also interestingly compacted to a 1.50 aspect ratio, making the frame of the screen quite box like. This is perhaps also relevant to the structure of the film in which most of the events and visitations of external characters are pre-organised into a range of numbered shoeboxes, which is afforded a lengthy sequence, with plenty of overview shots of the boxes neatly arranged. Each section of the film that follows pertains to a certain box. Viewers are reminded as to which box they are in through a range of title cards which divides the film into a series of vignettes, not unlike Anderson\u2019s chapter structure inThe Royal Tenenbaums. This earlier film is perhaps his better-known one about the estrangement and reconnection of dysfunctional family members. This trait can also be found inThe Darjeeling Limitedaboard a train, or in a submarine inThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.The Phoenician Schemeechoes these familiar tropes (domestic dysfunction wrapped in whimsical packaging) aboard a number of private plane journeys (with a token train scene in the middle). While it may feel like a familiar journey aboard a new vessel, that familiarity will probably be either the reason you enjoy the ride \u2013 or the very thing that makes it feel like an exhausting commute, one where you\u2019re tempted to pull the emergency cord. While there is much to enjoy, I doubtThe Phoenician Schemewill be remembered as one of Anderson\u2019s most essential works. At times, it teeters on the edge of parodying its own auteur style. Despite this I found it compelling enough to spark a renewed interest in his earlier films. And any work that can reignite curiosity, even while treading familiar ground, is worth your time, even if it\u2019s only for a chance to play cameo bingo.

        "raw_text": "A new trend has been flooding our social media feeds of late. It seems like every time we swipe, we\u2019re seeing footage of activewear-clad partiers cramming into cafes, coffee shops and bakeries, with DJs taking over espresso counters to deliver banger-filled sets to buzzing crowds of gyrating punters. Yep, morning raves are a thing and Australians are getting on board in ever-increasing numbers, swapping late-night revelry in favour of a new form of sunrise socialising. Brisbane is the latest Australian city to get onboard the craze, which has already popped up in theUS,UK,Mexico,Austria,Canada,Argentinaand theNetherlands. While coffee-shop parties have been done in the past, it seems as if they spiked in popularity over the past year. So, what has spurred this sudden enthusiasm for early starts and pumping beats? Broadly speaking, coffee parties seem to be the latest trend to emerge from an overarching movement towards wellness-aligned recreation and conscious connection \u2013 a lifestyle that has become increasingly popular in the wake of Covid-era lockdowns. The rise of morning raves also reflects a growing trend among younger generations, who are drinking less alcohol than previous generations and adopting a sober-curious approach to socialising. \u201cI think the younger generations are shifting towards more of a wellness lifestyle,versus going out late, binge drinking and partying that way,\u201d says Daniella Boughen who, alongside Cameron Stallard, launched monthly event seriesAM Socialat Fonzie Abbott in Brisbane a month ago. \u201c[Cameron] was inspired byAM Radioover in Los Angeles. They throw these insane car park and cafe partiesand he was really excited to bring that to Brisbane,\u201dBoughen said. \u201cAlot of people that are hitting the ages of 25 to 35 feel like they still want to be able to go to things,but they might have extra responsibilities or have young families,\u201d addsKonrad Lancaster, who co-foundedCaffeine Clubalongside Josh Newton. \u201cWe\u2019re at the age that we no longer want to go out and socialise in the nightclub scene, butwe still want tohave fun and we still want to be able to have a dance.\u201d So far early morning parties have taken on various forms. Caffeine Club has a rotating roster of local DJs that plays open-air sets every Sunday morning at Joey\u2019s in Brisbane\u2019s Kangaroo Point, serving mocktails, wellness shots and the all-important coffee until 10am. Meanwhile, over in the Brisbane suburb of Bulimba, Darvella Patisserie recently threw a bakery rave inside its Oxford Street shopfront, swapping glow sticks for croissants and Red Bull for flat whites. Though each event is slightly different, all coffee raves have the same thing in common \u2013 they all promote a sense of freedom and connection. \u201cI think the attraction there is just good music and good people,\u201d says Lancaster. \u201cIt\u2019s just about having a dance and letting loose in a really cool and safe spot \u2013 listening to some loud music, having a dance and getting lost in the moment,\u201d he said. Much like run clubs before them, morning raves are proving a much-needed boost to the local hospitality scene, which is grappling with the effects of rising operational costs and cost-of-living pressures. As consumers look to get more bang for their buck and more experience-based hospitality, cafes are eager to lure in custom by offering ahigh-energy, alcohol-free atmosphere that\u2019s just as invigorating as a double-shot ristretto. Speaking of run clubs,Boughenbelieves morning raves are also a natural extension of the weekend jog gatherings, which endure as a popular feel-good outlet for those looking to foster new connections. \u201cRun clubs have become the new way to meet people \u2013I think many people are dating through run clubs now,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re ultimately aboutis just creating an environmentwhere people can connect with thosewho have similar interests,but without that late-night kind of alcohol-fuel regret the next day.\u201d Whether we\u2019re watching the birth of a new way to party or simply the latest viral trend, right now coffee raves are poised to only build in popularity. Lancaster is optimistic about the continued growth of the movement, citing global trends in wellness and Brisbane\u2019s own reputation as a morning city. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re anywhere near its peak. I think it\u2019s still very fresh in Australia, people aren\u2019t quite aware that it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s definitely something that is going to just turn it all up on its head \u2013 I feel like people are going to be stopping the late nights and trading them for the mornings.\u201d",

        "raw_text": "Beloved Australian actor Magda Szubanski has revealed she\u2019s been diagnosed with a \u201cvery rare, very aggressive, very serious\u201d blood cancer called mantle cell lymphoma. In apost on social mediaon Thursday, Szubanski said she would be starting treatment in a few weeks for the stage four cancer, which she called \u201cone of the nasty ones, unfortunately\u201d. So, what is mantle cell lymphoma? And how is it treated? There are more than 100 subtypes of blood cancers, but they are commonly divided into one of two groups. These arebased onwhere they originate: leukaemias develop in the bone marrow, and lymphomas develop in the lymphatic system. Lymphomas develop from white blood cells (lymphocytes), which circulate in the blood and lymphatic system and help fight infection. You may not have heard of thelymphatic system, but it plays a key role in your immune response. The lymphatic circulatory system is responsible for transporting fluids (lymph) around your body.Lymphcomes from blood plasma, and helps remove waste from your tissues. As part of the lymphatic system, tissues like the spleen and thymus help produce many of the immune cells you use to fight infections. These cells are then housed in specialised organs called lymph nodes \u2013 small pea-sized glands located throughout your body. Lymph nodes are kind of like the \u201cwar room\u201d of yourimmunesystem. Your body contains hundreds of lymph nodes, and each contains millions of lymphocytes. These include the T and B cells \u2013 the main fighting cells in adaptive immunity. If B cells in an area of the lymph node known as the \u201cmantle zone\u201d become cancerous, it is called mantle cell lymphoma. In 2020,there were 330 casesof mantle cell lymphoma diagnosed in Australia, accounting for a small fraction (5 per cent) of lymphoma cases. Overall, lymphomas account for aroundone in 20new cancer diagnoses. This makes mantle cell lymphoma quite rare. Mantle cell lymphoma is aboutthree times more common in men than in women, and mostly affects people over the age of 60. Unfortunately, mantle cell lymphoma is largelyconsidered incurablewith the therapies currently available. Like many cancers, mantle cell lymphoma can vary in how quickly it develops and its severity. As Szubanski\u2019s cancer has been described as \u201cfast-moving\u201d and is already stage four, it appears that it is a more serious case. Stage four is the most advanced stage \u2013 meaning thecancer has spread(metastasised) to other tissues. Treatment at this stage can be more complicated than when the cancer is caught earlier. But treatment can still help people go on to live for many years. In her social media post, Szubanski said she will receive \u201cone of the best treatments available [the Nordic protocol]\u201d. This is one of the most common treatments for an aggressive lymphoma. The main component is \u201cR-CHOP\u201d \u2013 acombination therapy. It involves a mixture of different drugs, including chemotherapy, to attack the cancer from multiple angles at the same time. Different strengths of the drugs can be used (the maximum strength is sometimes called R-maxi-CHOP). A stem cell transplantation may also be included in the regimen. How effective this treatment is will depend on many different factors, including the type and stage of the lymphoma. The aim is to kill as many cancer cells as possible, and therefore extend a patient\u2019s life for as long as possible. Therapy also focuses on providing a high quality-of-life for patients. Szubanski\u2019s mantle cell lymphoma was detected during a breast cancer screen where,she says, \u201cthey found my lymph nodes were up\u201d. Imaging techniques, such as a mammogram or MRI, may detect tell-tale signs of lymphoma, such as swollen lymph nodes. However a biopsy \u2013a small sample of tissue from the affected area\u2013 would then be required to confirm the presence of cancer cells and identify what type. Blood cancer symptoms can be vague, but it\u2019s good to know what to look for. As well as swollen lymph nodes,symptoms of lymphomainclude nausea, tiredness, loss of appetite, fevers, gastrointestinal issues, unexplained weight loss, and night sweats. If you have any concerns, you should consult a doctor.

        "raw_text": "A man accused of stalking actor Jennifer Aniston and crashing his car through her front gate is mentally incompetent to stand trial, a judge has ruled. The move in a Los Angeles County mental health court came after a second psychiatrist examined the defendant, Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, and reached the same conclusion as the first: That his mental health would not allow him to answer to felony charges of vandalism and stalking of theFriendsstar. \u201cThe court finds the defendant is not currently competent to stand trial,\u201d Judge Maria Cavalluzzi said. \u201cCriminal proceedings will remain suspended.\u201d Carwyle, 48, of Mississippi, has pleaded not guilty. He appeared behind glass in a custody area of the courtroom and did not speak. He looked vastly different than his previous two court hearings. His scraggly grey hair and beard had been shorn, and he was wearing bright yellow county jail clothing after previously appearing with bare shoulders, wrapped in a blanket-like smock meant for suicide prevention. Carwyle had argued that he is competent, and exercised his right to a second opinion after an initial incompetence finding last week. \u201cIt\u2019s not the outcome my client would have preferred,\u201d Deputy Public Defender Robert Krauss told the judge. A conviction on the charges, along with an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm, could bring up to three years in prison for Carwyle. The incompetence finding has no set end date but it is temporary. The standard criminal process could resume later. Cavalluzzi ordered more comprehensive mental evaluations to help determine where and how he\u2019ll be held, and what his treatment will be. The judge also said a lawyer representing Aniston would be allowed to speak at the next hearing. Carwyle\u2019s next court date is June 26. Aniston\u2019s lawyer, Blair Berk, was in the courtroom observing on Thursday, but did not speak. He declined to comment outside court. Prosecutors allege Carwyle had harassed Aniston with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighbourhood of Los Angeles on May 5, causing major damage. A security guard stopped him in her driveway until police arrived. Authorities said Aniston was home at the time, but did not come into contact, and no one was injured. Aniston became one of television\u2019s biggest stars in her 10 years onFriendsfrom 1994. She won an Emmy Award for best lead actress in a comedy for the role, and she has been nominated for nine more. She stars inThe Morning Showon Apple TV+.

        "raw_text": "Cruel trolls have bombarded beloved comedy favourite Magda Szubanski after her shock revelation she is battling an \u201cobscure\u201d cancer. TheKath and Kimstar has endured a torrent of online abuse since she announced in an Instagram post on Thursdaythat she had stage-four mantle cell lymphoma, describing it as a \u201crare and fast-moving blood cancer\u201d. Szubanski went public in a video showing her shaven head, which she said was in preparation for treatment in which it would fall out. In her typical, positive style, the 64-year-old smiled and laughed throughout her video, at one point cackling as she said \u201cwhat are you gonna do?\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t sugar-coat it, it\u2019s rough,\u201d the 64-year-old wrote of her diagnosis. \u201cBut I\u2019m hopeful. I\u2019m being lovingly cared for by friends and family, my medical team is brilliant, and I\u2019ve never felt more held by the people around me.\u201d But her announcement has been met with an ugly wave of abuse. Some social media users have suggested Szubanski\u2019s Covid vaccinations are the reason for her disease. Szubanski fronted an ad for the Victorian government at the height of the pandemic \u2013 drawing the ire of anti-vaxxers and others unhappy with Covid measures. This latest trolling taps into an anti-vaccination conspiracy theory that alleges people who have been inoculated against the virus are at risk of issues such as fast-developing cancers and heart problems. \u201cVery sad to hear another experimental vaccine pusher has been diagnosed with something horrible. I guess you must \u2018face the consequences\u2019 of your choice now?\u201d wrote one X user. \u201cI have as much sympathy for her as she had for us that said no!\u201d wrote another. A third said: \u201cTurbo cancer comes to mind \u2026 Although she wasn\u2019t so charitable with us \u2018anti-vaxxers\u2019, I still wish her the best.\u201d Other social media users rushed to Szubanski\u2019s defence, with the multiple exchanges enough to keep the comedian\u2019s name trending on X nearly 24 hours after her announcement. \u201cAnti-vaxxers don\u2019t want to be treated with contempt by society, then behave abhorrently online. Magda Szubanski reveals blood cancer, then you post your cooker rubbish all over news articles,\u201d wrote one supporter. \u201cThink of her and her family and friends. You\u2019re not cookers, you are just scum.\u201d There was also an outpouring of support from prominent Australians. Former Australian of the Year Grace Tame led a string of well-wishers in comments on Szubanski\u2019s post. \u201cSending you all the love in the world and warm, immuno-safe virtual hugs,\u201d she wrote. TV presenter Lisa Wilkinson said all of Australia was behind the comedian. \u201cSending love, strength and every ounce of joy you have given all of us over the decades, to help see you through these difficult times darling Magda,\u201d she wrote. Others to send love included entertainers Rove McManus, Peter Helliar and Julia Zemiro, along with model Megan Gale and singer Dannii Minogue. The Leukaemia Foundation says mantle cell lymphoma affects the outer-edge \u2013 or mantle zone \u2013 of B-cells in the lymph node follicle. It accounts for about five to 10 per cent of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas, with the average age at diagnosis between 60 and 65 years. Szubanski said she would lie low while her immune system \u201ctakes a hammering\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling pretty ratshit for ages. So I asked for extra bloods and \u2013 voila,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe takeaway is, get tested and listen to your body.\u201d Szubanski is perhaps best known for winning the hearts of Australians as the sporty, unlucky-in-love Sharon Strzelecki in sitcomKath and Kim.That sparked roles in the smash-hit moviesBabeandHappy Feet(and both sequels), among others. She first burst onto Australian screens in the mid-1980s after being picked up by ABC talent scouts who\u2019d seen her perform in a university revue. Her credits include sketch showsFast Forwardand critically acclaimedBig Girl\u2019s Blouse, alongsideKath and Kimco-writers Gina Riley and Jane Turner. The comedian was a prominent marriage equality campaigner after coming out as gay in 2012. She used her profile to push for a yes vote in the 2017 Australian referendum on same-sex marriage, including a pivotal appearance on the ABC\u2019sQ&Aprogram and an address to the National Press Club. -with AAP",

        "raw_text": "Deadpoolstar Hugh Jackman has joined other A-list actors and sporting stars to star in a campaign against family violence that will debut at a major footy clash. Jackman and fellow Hollywood star Eric Bana, cricketer Usman Khawaja, funnyman Hamish Blake, AFL footballers and other high-profile Australian men took part in a video campaign initiated by the head of the family court. \u201cFamily violence harms too many Australians each year,\u201d Jackman says in the video. \u201cFamily violence is a national disgrace,\u201d Bana adds. The video will be shown during the Collingwood-Hawthorn AFL game on Friday night at the MCG and also features the captains of both teams. \u201cLet\u2019s lead by example and show our children and young men that violence is never OK,\u201d Hawks captain James Sicily says. Pies skipper Darcy Moore says all men have a role to play in helping to end men\u2019s violence against women. \u201cBy calling out disrespect when we see it and when we hear it and never making excuses for violence, all men can help end violence against women in our community,\u201d he says. Retired NRL star Johnathan Thurston, musician Vance Joy and comedian Mick Molloy also lent their voices to the campaign. It was initiated by Federal Circuit and Family Court Chief Justice Will Alstergren, who hoped the video would call out behaviour while stressing men must be part of the conversation about domestic violence. He said he had been stunned to find family violence involved in more than 70 per cent of cases coming before his courts \u2013 and few men did anything to call it out. \u201cIt was really obvious that men just aren\u2019t part of the conversation about this,\u201d Alstergren said. \u201cAt least four out of five men don\u2019t perpetrate family violence. But they\u2019re either apathetic about it or, alternatively, they\u2019re too worried or too nervous to be part of the conversation. \u201cIf Hugh Jackman can do this in New York while he\u2019s promoting a movie, and if Eric Bana can do it, and if Travis Fimmel is prepared to do it, then why aren\u2019t ordinary blokes prepared to get out and do something? \u201cSchool teachers, footy coaches, everyone, we can all have a big impact.\u201d Alstergren also\u00a0called for greater wraparound supports for victim-survivors and perpetrators. \u201cSomething must be done to prevent this behaviour before it occurs, and men need to be part of that conversation and the solution,\u201d he said. \u201cMen who hold leadership positions, especially in an area that sees some of the worst of gendered violence, should feel compelled to be part of the push for change. \u201cFor Australians, sport is the perfect arena in which to start these conversations.\u201d Jesuit Social Services Men\u2019s Project executive director Matt Tyler said many men who committed domestic abuse felt disconnected, which manifested as violence. \u201cWhile not all men perpetrate violence, all men working in solidarity in victim-survivors can play a role in creating communities where everyone can lead healthy lives,\u201d he said. 1800 RESPECT 1800 737 732 Lifeline 131 114 Men\u2019s Referral Service 1300 766 491 National Sexual Abuse and Redress Support Service 1800 211 028 -with AAP",

        "raw_text": "Wellness tourism isbooming. Think yoga retreats in Bali, digital detox weekends in a rainforest, or a break on a luxury island to \u201cfind yourself\u201d. It\u2019s no longer just about taking selfies at the beach or in front of Instagrammable landmarks. Travellers today want to invest in activities aimed at improving their mental, spiritual and physicalwellbeing. And, they\u2019re willing to pay for these experiences. Global spending on wellness tourism is projected to hitUS$8.5 trillion(A$13.2 trillion) by 2027. Rather than being apassing fad, spending in this sector is forecast to nearlytriple by 2035. This is big business. The Wellness Tourism Association says90 per cent of travellersreport wellness activities are an essential part of their travel itineraries. But, while holidaymakers pursue their zen, the workforce is largely overlooked. The massage therapists, spa staff, yoga instructors and retreat hosts \u2013 oftenwomen, migrants and workers from the Global South\u2013 frequently experience substandard, undignified working conditions. Our new report,In Decent or Dirty Work?,examines an often overlooked part of the wellness industry. We propose a model to shift the industry from \u201cdirty to decent\u201d in line with the United Nations\u2019 sustainable development goal eight supporting\u201cdecent work and economic growth\u201d. The17 sustainable development goals (SDGs)were adopted by all UN member states in 2015. They support ending poverty and other deprivations as part of improving health and education, reducing inequality and encouraging economic growth \u2013 while tackling climate change and protecting the environment. These goals are designed to help businesses and governments develop sustainable and inclusive economies. Progress towards decent work in wellness tourism is undermined by workers in some cases facing low pay, insecure employment andpoor working conditions. Wellness is often viewed asfeminised work, rather than skilled or professional. Workers are expected to be calm, warm and nurturing, as well as emotionally available while juggling demanding workloads and unpredictable hours. Gaps in standards and regulation leave workers vulnerable. For example,Massage and Myotherapy Australiahas raised concerns about exploitative contracting and loose employment arrangements. Without regulated certification, enforcement of fair contracts, and professional recognition, many workers experience underemployment or unsafe conditions. Research shows workers at some spas even describe their roles as feeling uncomfortably close tosex work, especially in settings where the boundaries are blurred and expectations can cross a moral line. The case of theMelbourne businesspenalised for underpaying migrant workers and reports of Asian massage therapists being asked regularly for\u201chappy endings\u201dreflect the devaluation and gendered risks for this workforce. Sociologists call this\u201cdirty work\u201d\u2013 jobs that are not physically messy but carry an emotional or moral burden. And while these roles are pivotal to customers\u2019 experiences, the people doing them are often invisible. This makes it even harder to push forbetter training or fairer conditions. To improve the wellness industry\u2019s sustainability and fairness, our research proposes three key changes. On an individual level, workers need to be empowered. Workers who have a connection with their job will gain personal fulfilment from helping clients with their health and relaxation. Satisfied workers meanshappier customers and superior work quality. However, workers should also receive external support to help improve job satisfaction. For example, management regularly reinforcing the value of staff to a business can enhance a worker\u2019s sense of dignity. Additionally, protecting workers from such threats as immoral requests by customers, is key to cultivating the sense of a safe and dignified workplace. At the macro-level, policies, social structures and public perceptions shape how wellness work is valued. Without professional accreditation or recognition, these jobs will remain undervalued. Broader changes, like government reforms and public campaigns, would lift professional recognition and support dignity. Employees\u2019working conditionsshould be examined. Decent work \u2013 as per the UN sustainable development goals \u2013 means providing fair pay, safe environments, recognition and genuine opportunities for employees to develop and thrive at work. Also, investing in bettertraining and standardsbenefits everyone, whether workers, businesses or customers. AsAndrew Gibson, co-founder of the Wellness Tourism Association, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think wellness is a fad, but rather it\u2019s a change in society, and what society now expects\u201d.

        "raw_text": "UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage Committee has again raised grave fears for the future of the Great Barrier Reef, highlighting the problems of water pollution, climate change and unsustainable fishing. The committee on Mondayreleased draft decisionsregarding the conservation of 62 World Heritage properties. This included the Great Barrier Reef, for which it noted: \u201cOverall, while progress has been made, significant challenges remain in achieving water quality targets, managing extreme climate impacts, and ensuring the long-term resilience of the property.\u201d The comments confirm what experts already know too well: despite substantial investments from successive Australian governments, threats to the Great Barrier Reef remain. Climate change is the greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef and other coral reefsaround the world. But water pollution is the most significant local threat. That issue, along with unsustainable fishing, is entirely within Australia\u2019s control. The World Heritage Committee will consider the draft decision at its nextmeeting in Paris in July. It may amend the decision, but the concerns are now on the public record. The Great Barrier Reef has been on UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage list for more than 40 years. The listingrecognisesoutstanding natural and cultural places around the world. The reef is jointly managed by the Australian and Queensland governments. UNESCO\u2019s draft decision expressed \u201cutmost concern\u201d at the findings of last year\u2019soutlook report, published by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. It noted: \u201cthe overall outlook for the property remains one of continued deterioration due largely to climate change, while the long-term outlook for the ecosystem of the property also remains \u2018very poor\u2019.\u201d Poor water quality is a major issue on the Great Barrier Reef. It is caused when sediment, nutrients, pesticides and pollution from land-based activities, such as land clearing, farming and coastal development, are carried into the ocean. In its draft decision, UNESCO noted with \u201cregrets\u201d that the latest water quality targets for sediment and nitrogen \u2013 a key component offertilisers\u2013 were not achieved. UNESCO said the updated water quality plan should ensure targets and actions \u201care sufficiently ambitious and funded\u201d. As the below graph shows, actions from 2009 to now have reduced pollution only by about half the desired amounts. At the existing rate of progress and funding commitments, the targets will not be met until 2047 (for sediment) and 2114 (for dissolved inorganic nitrogen). Huge gapsexist between current pollutants levels and thewater quality targets. These and some other targets are wellout of reachunder existing funding levels.  The draft decision also requests a halt to illegal land clearing while strengthening vegetation laws \u2013 both fundamental to reducing water pollution. Severe weather events exacerbate the water quality problem. In February this year, for example, floodwaters from ten major rivers merged to formextensive flood plumesalong 700 kilometres of coastline from Cairns to Mackay, and up to 100 kilometres offshore. Such plumes can remain present for months after a flood. They can smother seagrass and corals, and cause damaging algal growth. UNESCO\u2019s draft decision noted \u201cthe overall outlook for the property remains one of continued deterioration due largely to climate change\u201d. Ocean heatwaves can lead to coral bleaching and potentially death. Mass bleachingoccurred again this yearon the Great Barrier Reef \u2013 the sixth such event since 2016. UNESCO described as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d preliminary results showing heat stress was the highest on record during the 2023\u201324 mass bleaching event. Climate change is also expected to produce more frequent and intense extreme weather events such astropical cyclones, which can damage reefs and island ecosystems. UNESCO called on Australia to align its policies with the global goal of \u201climiting global temperature to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels\u201d, and to take steps to mitigate negative impacts from extreme weather events.  Unsustainable fishing practices damage the Great Barrier Reef. UNESCO\u2019s draft decision noted progress in eliminating gillnet fishing, which is on track for the target of 2027. The fishing method involvesmesh netswhich can accidentally kill other wildlife, including threatened species such as dugongs, turtles, dolphins andsawfish. But smaller nets can still be used throughout much of the World Heritage area, so some threats to threatened species remain. UNESCO also urged Australia to expand electronic monitoring of commercial fishing vessels, and to ensure the targets in itsSustainable Fisheries Strategyare met. It also called for a comprehensive review ofcoral harvesting, which primarily supplies the global aquarium trade. Despite thesignificant resourcesand management efforts Australia expends on the Great Barrier Reef, serious threats remain. The Great Barrier Reef is struggling under the cumulative impacts of amultitude of threats. The problems outlined above are not isolated challenges. Both the Queensland and Australian governments could do far more to boost the health of the reef. Clearly, more funding is needed. Without it, the future of the Great Barrier Reef is in jeopardy, and so too its tourism and fishing economies, and thousands of jobs. UNESCO has now asked Australia to provide more comprehensive results from the recent mass bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, along with an updated plan to improve water quality. Its draft decision maintains the spotlight on conservation concerns for this precious natural asset. Jon C.

        "raw_text": "A stunt performer has sued Kevin Costner, alleging she was subjected to an unscripted rape scene without proper warning, consent or protocols while shooting his filmHorizon: An American Saga: Chapter 2. Devyn LaBella filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court. It names Costner \u2013 the director, star and co-writer of theHorizonseries of Westerns \u2013 and its production companies as defendants. \u201cThe impact of this impromptu work demand on Ms LaBella has been profound, not only upending a career Ms LaBella spent years building but leaving her with permanent trauma that she will be required to address for years to come,\u201d the lawsuit says. Costner\u2019s lawyer said the lawsuit had no merit, and LaBella\u2019s assertions were contradicted by the facts and her behaviour. A former gymnast, the 34-year-old LaBella has worked steadily as a Hollywood stunt performer since 2020, with credits includingBarbieandYellowjackets. LaBella\u2019s lawsuit says she was the stunt double for one of theHorizonleads, Ella Hunt, throughout the production. The shoot included a planned sexual assault scene, shot in May 2023, that LaBella performed much of because of its violent and physical nature, the lawsuit says. For that scene, protocols were followed, including meetings, rehearsals, the presence of an intimacy coordinator and minimal crew. But it alleges that the following day, in an unscripted scene with no warning, rehearsal or choreography, Costner directed an actor to pin LaBella down on a wagon and simulate rape. The lawsuit says Costner asked for many takes as he experimented with the violent action and did not make it clear when a shot was beginning or ending. \u201cThere was no escaping the situation, and all Ms LaBella could do was wait for the nightmare to end,\u201d the suit says. It alleges that safeguards were ignored in violation of union contracts and industry standards. Costner\u2019s lawyer, Martin Singer, said while the star wanted everyone to be comfortable on his sets, LaBella\u2019s claim had \u201cabsolutely no merit, and it is completely contradicted by her own actions \u2013 and the facts\u201d. \u201cThe scene in question was explained to Ms LaBella, and after she performed the rehearsal in character with another actor, she gave her stunt co-ordinator supervisor a \u2018thumbs up\u2019 and indicated her willingness to then shoot the scene, if needed (which she was not),\u201d Singer said. \u201cThat night, Ms LaBella had dinner with her supervisor, the stunt coordinator, and with the assistant stunt coordinator, and she was in good spirits and made no complaints to them. She continued to work on the movie for a few more weeks until her wrap date, and she took the stunt co-ordinator to a thank-you dinner.\u201d Singer provided an image of a text message LaBella sent her stunt coordinator at the end of production saying, \u201cThank you for these wonderful weeks!\u201d. Singer said LaBella was \u201ca serial accuser of people in the entertainment industry\u201d. The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as LaBella has done. The lawsuit seeks damages in an amount to be determined at trial. It also seeks a judge\u2019s order for the defendants to undergo sexual harassment training, to be required to use an intimacy co-ordinator on future productions and to issue LaBella a public apology. 1800 RESPECT 1800 737 732 National Sexual Abuse and Redress Support Service 1800 211 028 Lifeline 131 114 Men\u2019s Referral Service 1300 766 491 -AAP",

        "raw_text": "Hugh Jackman has raised eyebrows with a gleeful social media post after his ex-wife, Deborra-Lee Furness, broke her silence on their split. Furness, 69, releaseda scorching statement on Wednesday about the end of her marriage toThe Greatest Showmanactor, 56. The comments came as it was revealed Furness had filed for divorce, formally ending the couple\u2019s 20-year-plus marriage. \u201cMy heart and compassion goes out to everyone who has traversed the traumatic journey of betrayal,\u201d she told the Nine Network. \u201cIt\u2019s a profound wound that cuts deep. However, I believe in a higher power and that God/the universe, whatever you relate to as your guidance, is always working FOR us.\u201d It was Furness\u2019s first public remarks since the Australian couple confirmed their split in a joint statement in September 2023. Only hours later, Jackman posted a video of himself skipping rope on stage as part of his one-man stage showHugh Jackman Live \u2014 From New York with Love. Alongside the clip of a beaming Jackman is his solitary comment: \u201cFINALLY\u201d. The Instagram post to his 34 million followers appeared to be about the performer \u201cfinally\u201d nailing a tricky skipping routine for the show. But what really raised eyebrows was the backing music, NSYNC\u2019s break-up songBye Bye Bye. While Jackman skips on stage, NSYNC\u2019s vocals cut in with the lyrics: \u201cSo I\u2019m leaving you behind, \u201cI don\u2019t want to make it tough, \u201cBut I\u2019ve had enough, \u201cAnd it ain\u2019t no lie, \u201cBye, bye.\u201d Jackman and Furness met on the set of Australian seriesCorrelliin 1995 and married a year later. They share two adult adopted children, son Oscar and daughter Ava. \u201cWe have been blessed to share almost 3 decades together as husband and wife in a wonderful, loving marriage. Our journey now is shifting and we have decided to separate to pursue our individual growth,\u201d they wrote in 2023 to announce their break-up. The statement was signed \u201cDeb and Hugh Jackman\u201d. This week, lawyer Elena Karabatos filed documents in a New York court on behalf of Furness, related to the former couple\u2019s divorce settlement, health care coverage, and medical child support. \u201cThere was some back and forth regarding this financial agreement but, in the end, [Furness] got what she believed she deserved. Both are coming out of this financially secure,\u201d a source told theDaily Mail. \u201cThere is not going to be any drama \u2026 This gives closure that she needed.\u201d TheDaily Mailreports a lengthy deliberation over the division of the former couple\u2019s assets, although no further details about the settlement have been revealed. A judge\u2019s sign off is all that is required to formalise the end of the marriage as the terms of the divorce are uncontested. Furness said she had gained \u201cmuch knowledge and wisdom\u201d in navigating the end of her marriage. \u201cEven when we are presented with apparent adversity, it is leading us to our greatest good, our true purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is so easy to get lost in looking for love and validation outside ourselves, but that\u2019s not where it lives \u2013 it lives within. Sometimes the universe has to create arduous circumstances for us to walk through in order to find our way home, back to our true essence and the sovereignty of self love.\u201d She said she had found \u201cliberation and freedom\u201d post-split and was \u201cgrateful\u201d for her life path. \u201cIt can hurt, but in the long run, returning to yourself and living within your own integrity, values and boundaries is liberation and freedom,\u201d she said. \u201cOne thing I have learned is that none of this is personal, we are all on our individual journeys and I believe that the relationships in our lives are not random. \u201cWe are drawn to people, we invite them in, in order to learn our lessons and to recognise and heal the broken parts of ourselves.\u201d She finished: \u201cI remain grateful.\u201d Since the couple\u2019s split, Furness has been spotted attending numerous events solo. She was also at the Australian Open in Melbourne with daughter Ava earlier this year. WolverineandDeadpoolstar Jackman, meanwhile, was been repeatedly linked with fellow actor Sutton Foster, 50. She was his co-star in Broadway\u2019sMusic Manand divorced her own husband, Ted Griffin, in late 2024. Jackman and Foster were first romantically linked in late 2023 \u2013 just two months after he and Furness split. \u201cThey are 100 per cent together and are in love and want to spend the rest of their lives together,\u201d a source toldPage Six.",

        "raw_text": "Scientists have designed a fuel cell they say could deliver three times as much energy per unit of weight as existing lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. Unlike a battery, the liquid sodium-air device needs only to be refuelled, not recharged. Luckily, sodium (a constituent of table salt) is inexpensive and one of the most abundant elements on Earth. The researchers envision a fully developed version of the technology could help electrify hard-to-decarbonise transport systems, such as aircraft, ships, and trains. The chemical reaction also produces useful sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as a discharge product, which could be saved and used commercially as caustic soda. Crucially, NaOH has another property: It readily combines with carbon dioxide (CO2) to form sodium carbonate, which in turn forms sodium bicarbonate or baking soda. NaOH has been explored as a potential vehicle for carbon capture and use (CCU). But its high cost and carbon footprint associated with production have remained barriers to widespread adoption. In an enclosed system, the researchers envision NaOH could be retained and later used to capture and sequester CO2 from point sources. In an open system, such as on an aircraft, NaOH could instead be discharged during operation to combine with CO2 in the atmosphere. If the resulting sodium bicarbonate ends up in the ocean, the researchers say it would help towards deacidifying it to counter another damaging effect of CO2. \u201cWe expect people to think that this is a totally crazy idea,\u201d said Yet-Ming Chiang, senior author of the study and professor of Materials Science and Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be a bit disappointed because if people don\u2019t think something is totally crazy at first, it probably isn\u2019t going to be that revolutionary. \u201cPeople have been aware of the energy density you could get with metal-air batteries for a very long time, and it\u2019s been hugely attractive, but it\u2019s just never been realised in practice.\u201d In their study published in the journalJoule, Chiang and colleagues outline the production of two lab-scale prototypes of their new system. In the H cell prototype, two vertical glass tubes are connected by a tube across the middle. Liquid sodium metal fills the tube on one side and humid air flows through the other. The connecting horizontal tube contains a solid ceramic electrolyte, which allows sodium ions to pass freely through, and a porous air-facing electrode that helps the sodium to chemically react with oxygen to produce electricity. The other prototype uses a horizontal design, with a tray of the electrolyte material holding the liquid sodium fuel. The porous air electrode, which facilitates the reaction, is in the bottom of the tray. Tests using an air stream with a carefully controlled humidity level produced nearly 1700 watt-hours per kilogram at the level of an individual \u201cstack. Chiang said that would translate to more than 1000 watt-hours at the full system level. \u201cThe threshold that you really need for realistic electric aviation is about 1000 watt-hours per kilogram,\u201d he said. Reaching this, he said, would enable electric aviation for regional flights, which account for about 80 per cent of domestic flights and 30 per cent of emissions from aviation. The technology could be an enabler for other sectors as well, including marine and rail transportation. \u201cThey all require very high energy density, and they all require low cost,\u201d Chiang said. \u201cThat\u2019s what attracted us to sodium metal.\u201d While the prototype is a small, single cell, Chiang said the system should be quite straightforward to scale up to practical sizes for commercialisation. Members of the research team have formed a company, Propel Aero, to further develop the technology. This article was first published inCosmos. Read the original here",

        "raw_text": "A 50-year extension to the North West Shelf (NWS) project in Western Australia would see huge amounts of gas given away with no return for Australians. While the exact volume and value is hard to predict, a basic estimate is that up to $215 billion worth of gas could be given away, royalty-free. The NWS liquefied natural gas facility, specifically the Karratha Gas Plant, producers up to 18.6 mega tonnes of LNG each year. At present, it sources around 75 per cent of its natural gas from the royalty-paying NWS gas fields off the coast of WA. These fields are the only major offshore gas project in WA that pays royalties, all others are royalty-free as the Commonwealth Government chooses not to charge a price for the public\u2019s gas. As we\u2019vepointed out before, the proponents of the NWS extension, Woodside, have not identified where all the gas will come from with major implications for WA gas prices. What is clear is that the royalty-paying NWS gas that feeds the Karratha Gas Plant is forecast to decline and it will increasingly be fed by gas from non-royalty paying reserves such as the Browse Basin, as shown in this chart that we first published here.  As shown in the above chart, it is possible that by 2036, none of the gas feeding the Karratha Gas Plant would be coming from royalty-paying reserves, although some gas could be sourced from Waitsia and other onshore or state-waters sources that would pay a royalty. Below, we conservatively assume that that 70 per cent of Karratha Gas Plant feedstock gas is royalty-free by the mid-2030s, and a price of $8 per gigajoule for gas, which is now common in WA wholesale trades. On these assumptions, the NWS shelf extension will be receiving around $5.1 billion a year in royalty-free gas, or $14 million each day, or $215 billion over the project\u2019s 46-year life. These calculations are shown in Table 1.  Across the 46-year extension of the project, a total $215 billion in free gas will be given away. For comparison, the output of the entire WA economy was $448 billion in 2024. Matt Saunders is a senior economist and Rod Campbell is research director at theAustralia Institute.",

        "raw_text": "Bono was jubilant and emotional at the Cannes premiere of his highly personal documentaryBono: Stories of Surrender, holding his wife Alison Hewson\u2019s hand and thanking his four children and his U2 bandmates and manager Paul McGuinness, for a life well lived. \u201cYou wrote this story,\u201d he said. Naming daughters Jordan and Eve and sons Jordan and Elijah, he noted: \u201cYou wrote the story and you continue to write your own story. I\u2019m very proud of you. The Edge (Dave Evans) wrote this story, Adam (Clayton, bassist) and Larry (Mullen Jr, drums) wrote this story. McGuinness wrote this story. We\u2019re still writing it \u2013 it\u2019s still a work in progress.\u201d Born Paul Hewson in 1960 in Dublin, Bono had initially written a 2022 memoir,Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story. To mark its publication the U2 frontman devised a one-man show described as \u201can evening of words, music and some mischief\u201d and embarked on a tour of intimate gigs throughout the US and Europe. In 2023 he teamed up with Australian director Andrew Dominik to recreate a filmed version of the show at New York\u2019s historic Beacon Theatre. Apart from a dynamic closing moment, Dominik shotStories of Surrenderin black-and-white as he did with 2016\u2019sOne More Time With Feeling,focusing on Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds. (Dominik also collaborated with Cave on 2022\u2019sThis Much I Know to be True,which was largely shot in black-and-white and drew on the death of Cave\u2019s son Arthur.)  Bono saysStories of Surrender, which he co-wrote with Bill Flanagan, is an attempt to cast off the mask of fame and reveal his true self. We see the singer, dressed in a black jacket, black pants and orange-tinted glasses, perform songs and tell of his life, recalling his mother Iris\u2019s death from a brain aneurysm when he was 14 and his fractured relationship with his hard-to-please opera-loving father, Brendan, a wannabe singer. Bono\u2019s saving grace was meeting Alison, whom he\u2019d known since they were 12. They got together three years later.\u201cShe was a 15-year-old girl who had faith in me, she encouraged my dreams,\u201d he says. Incredibly, he notes how he joined up with guitarist Dave Evans (Edge), bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr to form U2 in the same week. The band would achieve huge success, selling 170 million albums and winning a record-breaking 22 Grammys. In 1983 U2 had a huge hit with the politically chargedSunday Bloody Sunday,focusing on the violence in Northern Ireland. Two years later they sang at Live Aid, which raised US$250 million to feed starving refugees in Africa. \u201cWhere you live should not decide whether you live,\u201d he says in the show. \u201cLives matter, justice matters.\u201d While he admits to being overpaid and overfed \u2013\u201dhypocrites get a bad rap\u201d, he muses \u2013 he recalls the difficulties in his life. In 2016 a congenital heart condition almost killed him, but then the film becomes about his father. He left home at an early age to escape him. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I forgive my father. Surrender does not come easy,\u201d he says. But then Bono wonders if their fractured relationship was his fault. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could be a father because I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d been much of a son.\u201d In any case he says, \u201cI craved my father\u2019s attention and he didn\u2019t hear me, so I sang louder and louder.\u201d Bono now recognises that his father was grieving and was unable to support him through his mother\u2019s death. His father would not even mention her death in their Dublin home. He recalls his brother Norman giving him a guitar. \u201cI was singing Ramones\u2019 songs in the living room around my 18thbirthday and all my Da (father) wanted to talk to me about was getting a job. He didn\u2019t want to know about rock and roll.\u201d Later in life he would meet his father on Sundays in a Dublin pub. By this time Bono was famous and while he could recognise his father\u2019s pride\u00a0 \u2013 \u201cI heard your songPrideon the radio the other day and I might have felt some\u201d, he recalls his father saying \u2013he notes how he was only able to see him as a friend after his death from cancer in 2001. Still, he has some fond memories like when his father Brendan, an anti-royalist, met Princess Diana and was star struck.\u201cEight centuries of oppression melted away in eight seconds!\u201d Bono chortles. Bono\u2019s activism is also dealt with in the film and he later told one interviewer: \u201cYou know, even the change, the world stuff, comes back to me trying to impress my father. \u201cNow here I am with stories of surrender. The word surrender sounds preposterous in a moment when it seems like the planet is determined to set fire to itself. We\u2019re closer to a world war than at any time in my life. We have to evolve past violence. So that\u2019s my position, and I held it when I was 23 and was laughed and mocked. That\u2019s okay. John Lennon was prepared to look ridiculous for peace.\u201d At the Cannes premiere, Bono commended Plan B for producing the documentary. \u201cI want to thank Brad Pitt for not showing up, because he would steal the show,\u201d he said with a chuckle. He also addressed the late Steve Jobs, the Apple founder whose company helped finance the film. \u201cI visited Steve Jobs down the coast not so long ago and he was a man who had grown such a gigantic company. You treated me so tenderly. Imagine (Apple) paying for us to go to Italy to shoot that fantasy scene about my father.\u201d Bono also thanked Sean Penn, who was in the audience and had brought Ukrainian soldiers to the ceremony. \u201cIf I was in the trenches, like real trenches, as opposed to ones on a movie set, I\u2019d want to be with Sean Penn in those trenches,\u201d Bono said. He also thanked the musicians on stage, cellist Kate Ellis and harpist Gemma Doherty, who breathe fresh life into U2 hits includingSunday Bloody Sunday, Beautiful DayandPride (In the Name of Love). Lastly, Bono thanked director Andrew Dominik: \u201cOh my, he\u2019s not here, he\u2019s working,\u201d Bono said, attempting an Australian accent. \u201cAndrew, I love your vision, and I can\u2019t believe you got those performances out of me and thank you for that.\u201d Bono: Stories of Surrenderstreams on Apple TV+ from May 30.",

The Back To The Beginningshow on July 5 will see the 76-year-old singer deliver his own short set before he joins bandmates Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward \u2013 who will play together as a group for the first time in 20 years. \u201cI\u2019ll be there, and I\u2019ll do the best I can. So all I can do is turn up,\u201d he told theGuardian. In 2020, Osbourne revealed he had been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease and he paused touring in 2023 after extensive spinal surgery. \u201cYou wake up the next morning and find that something else has gone wrong. You begin to think this is never going to end,\u201d he said.

Former Van Halen frontman Sammy Hagar told rock radio showLoudwire Nightsthat he was informed Osbourne is \u201cgoing to try and sing five songs\u201d, including \u201cNo More Tears\u201d. Osbourne had a fall at home in 2019 which aggravated injuries from a near-fatal quad bike crash in 2003. The all-day event at Villa Park in Birmingham, the city where the heavy-rock pioneers formed in 1968, will also feature sets by a host of major metal bands including Metallica, Slayer and Alice In Chains. In 2017 the band played what was billed to be their \u201clast\u201d gig with Osbourne, guitarist Iommi and bassist Butler \u2013 but without Ward on drums. Black Sabbath\u2019s story began when Osbourne, Iommi, Butler and Ward were looking to escape a life of factory work. Their eponymous debut album in 1970 made the UK top 10 and paved the way for a string of hit records. They went on to become one of the most influential and successful metal bands of all time, selling more than 75 million albums worldwide. The group were inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 2006, and Osbourne was added for a second time in 2024. He previously celebrated his home city in 2022 when he helped close the Commonwealth Games.

        "raw_text": "Australia has a multitude of comeback stories \u2013 our America\u2019s Cup victory, Steven Bradbury\u2019s miracle on ice, even John Howard\u2019s political resurrection. Jimmy Barnes launched a successful solo career after leaving Cold Chisel and overcame addiction and health struggles (mostly he is included here so I can point you to anold columnabout him). I\u2019d argue we\u2019re about to see another unexpected comeback \u2013 online piracy. Back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the music industry was in full-blown panic mode. The culprits? Two names that still trigger nostalgia for elder millennials: Napster and Limewire. Music was purchased on CDs at the time, either as full albums or as singles. An album in 2000 probably set you back over $20. Downloading a music track as an MP3 file, albeit very illegally, via Napster was a quick and cheap (free) way to access new music. Blank CDs cost about a dollar in bulk. Suddenly you could build your own music library \u2014 cheaper and better than what the industry offered. If you listened to your music collection on the family PC, no costs other than the monthly internet bill were there to hold you back. Eventually, the music industry caught on. The iTunes Music Store launched in Australia in October 2005. A single song was priced at $1.69. Most albums were priced at $16.99. Not an amazing price, considering how cheap pirated music was, but convenient for the newly emerged iPod crowd. The real turning point didn\u2019t come until 2012 when Spotify launched in Australia (four years after its US and European debut) and changed everything. Music wasn\u2019t just cheaper, it was bundled into a monthly subscription. No need to plan which music to download, just stream any song you are interested in instantly. Why steal music when, for an affordable $11.99 per month, you have a superior user experience? A plethora of platforms copied the Spotify model. Today you can listen to (almost) any song you want on all platforms. Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, or Amazon Music Unlimited all offer essentially the same music experience. Music piracy largely died off. The quality and ease of the music subscription model is simply better than the cumbersome process of online piracy.  Recorded music revenues in the US fell from their heights of 1999 until 2014. By 2021 revenues surpassed 1999 levels. Granted, these numbers aren\u2019t adjusted for inflation, and music still isn\u2019t nearly as big a business as it was in 1999. Recorded music is now almost exclusively an online business. Profit margins are higher than they were in the past since the supply chain is much cheaper to handle for digital goods. All in all, the music industry reacted to online piracy and managed to live another day. So, online piracy is dead then and will never rise again? Not so fast, cowboy! Music isn\u2019t the only product that digital pirates share online. Movies, TV shows, video games and live sports are also merrily pirated. When Netflix launched in 2015 in Australia for $9.99 per month, it was a game-changer. We could legally access heaps of content without dodgy torrents and sites full of pornographic or gambling popups, or low-quality movie bootlegs. Want to add subtitles or switch audio language? No problem on Netflix. Piracy didn\u2019t disappear, but it no longer felt worth the hassle. For a brief moment, streaming movies and shows seemed to go the way of music streaming: a better user experience makes the use of pirated content obsolete. But that\u2019s not what happened. For movies and TV shows, the market also fragmented. Disney+, Paramount+, Amazon Prime, Stan, and countless others entered the scene. Unlike music platforms, where content heavily overlaps, each video service keeps its catalogue locked away. Video streaming once was a convenient solution but is now an annoying digital scavenger hunt without a decent treasure map. In arecent columnI suggested you watchThe Fisher King(1991). Where do you find the movie? No idea. You try streaming it right now and time yourself. How long until you have the movie up and running? It\u2019s cumbersome. And nothing is permanent. Titles vanish from libraries without warning. Even digital purchases can be deleted or restricted. Amazon\u2019s done exactly that. The only reliable way to keep a show? Download it illegally. Not exactly an anti-piracy strategy. To control costs and rights, streaming services became studios. Netflix now spends billions producing its own content. That content will not be available on other platforms. How many streaming services does your household subscribe to? It\u2019s five in mine at the moment (BeinSport, Stan, YouTube Plus, Amazon Prime, Disney+) but this will be cut down in a rage quit once I finish writing this column. We\u2019ve gone from bingeing everything on one platform to hoping our preferred service has something worth watching. Swapping subscriptions sounds good in theory, but in practice it\u2019s a chore. The psychology is clear, we don\u2019t cancel subscriptions the second we don\u2019t need them, and service providers use this behaviour against us. To make the user experience worse, platforms like Netflix that once encouraged password sharing now crack down on it. Ad-free tiers quietly include ads. Maybe you are on an overseas trip and want to stream something? Good luck. Your library is limited or might not work at all in the case of sports (Stan and BeinSport). Over the last few years, services asked for more money while offering less certainty. In the early days of Netflix, users spoke highly of the platform. It\u2019s rare to find people praising a platform these days. Disney+ for example only has a very limited number of movies available in German \u2013 that would be my particular use case for the platform \u2013 easy language learning for the kids. Heaps of migrant families in Australia complain about the lack of content in their mother tongue even though its available. Unsurprisingly, frustrated viewers have been returning to piracy\u2014not because they want to steal, but because that\u2019s the only option. Even Netflix, in its own reports, acknowledges piracy is back. Today\u2019s pirate sites look and feel like legitimate platforms \u2013 except they\u2019re free and have broader libraries. Video games are harder to pirate than ever since more and more titles are multiplayer games that run on official servers. Also, more and more games are consumed on smartphones and illegal software can\u2019t conveniently be installed via the Apple and Android app stores. For sports, the need to use illegal services is even bigger because the user experience is outrageously bad especially for fans following international or niche competitions. I for example want to watch my favourite German football team, Bayern Munich, play. The Bundesliga, the German league, is shown on BeinSport ($14.99/month). The UEFA Champions League is shown on STAN. You can\u2019t just purchase access to STAN Sport which is $15/month,\u00a0 you have to purchase a STAN Standard ($17) or STAN Premium ($22) package too. Bayern Munich also play in the FIFA Club World Cup in June \u2013 that\u2019s shown on yet another platform (Optus Sport $24.99). Football fans follow a club, not a competition. A meaningful bundle would be all games across all competitions from your club. But by splitting streaming rights to different platforms, three rather than one platform can make profits from sporting fans. Watching sports, especially international sports, is stupendously expensive and cumbersome if you are a law-abiding customer. So, what\u2019s ahead? Video streaming services will not change their business model as long as it\u2019s profitable. In Australia they still have a rich consumer base that is able to pay high prices for ever worsening user experiences. The legal services will continue the status quo. I would expect that in times of a prolonged cost-of-living crisis more Australian households will look to cut the high subscription fees and look at illegal alternatives. Turning to illegal sites will bring new cybersecurity risks \u2013 because, nostalgia aside, pirate sites still make money somehow, often through shady means.

        "raw_text": "Robbie Williams has opened up about his struggles with fame. The singer took to Instagram with a lengthy post explaining how fans asking for selfies can cause him discomfort and panic, and shared examples from a recent flight in the US. \u201cI\u2019ve had three interactions so far with fellow passengers. One of them handed me a lovely note \u2013 kind words about my documentary \u2013 and then asked for a photo,\u201d Williams said. He said he wrote a note back explaining how he\u2019d had little sleep, wrangled four children through the airport, and that his anxiety would spike if they came and took a photo because the whole cabin would then begin wondering who he was. A steward then asked for a selfie on behalf of another passenger, before a third passenger then just walked up and asked outright for a selfie to which he agreed, Williams said. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of unspoken law: as a celebrity, you should be accessible 24/7. Greet all strangers like you\u2019re the mayor of the best town anyone\u2019s ever visited. Make sure their wishes are met, whatever they are,\u201d the singer added. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019re a ****.\u201d There\u2019s no in-between. I\u2019ve seen the argument: These people put you where you are should.\u201d \u201cBut that thinking\u2019s off. I reckon over 50 per cent \u2013 probably much more couldn\u2019t name one of my albums, let alone say they\u2019ve bought a ticket to a show. They\u2019re no more fans of me than they are of the Leaning Tower of Pisa or Big Ben. They\u2019re fans of fame \u2026\u201d Robbie went on to explain the reasons he might not want to take a picture, then asked people to \u201clet people be people\u201d. \u201cHumans, struggling \u2013 like we all are in one way or another. Allow people the dignity of their privacy, their wants, their needs. Because most of us are just trying to protect ourselves \u2013 mentally, physically, or both. Just like you.\u201d Williams received support on the post from his fellow celebrities, with Kris Jenner commenting: \u201cWow so beautifully said and I really understand this \u2026 thanks for being so brave and vulnerable and for explaining this so thoughtfully and so well \u2026 sending love. God Bless.\u201d Adam Lambert wrote: \u201cthis resonates.

US District Judge Monica Almadani in Los Angeles in a ruling said the writers of Vince Vance and the Valiants\u2019All I Want for Christmas Is Youfailed to show their song was objectively similar enough to Carey\u2019s to support their copyright infringement case. Lawyers for the songwriters, lawyers for Carey and spokespeople for her label, Sony Music, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the decision on Thursday (local time). Vince Vance and the Valiants\u2019All I Want for Christmas Is Youwas released in 1989 and reached the Billboard country charts during holiday seasons in the 1990s. Carey\u2019s song appeared on her 1994 albumMerry Christmasand has become a popular standard, topping theBillboardHot 100 chart every holiday season since 2019.All I Want For Christmas Is Youis reported to have earned more than $US60 million ($A95 million) since it was first released. Andy Stone, who performs as Vince Vance, and co-writer Troy Powersfiled the lawsuit in 2023.They said Carey\u2019s song copied their song\u2019s \u201cextended comparison between a loved one and trappings of seasonal luxury\u201d and other lyrical and musical elements, requesting at least $US20 million ($A32 million) in damages.

Almadani also ordered the songwriters to pay part of Carey\u2019s lawyers\u2019 fees, finding some of their filings contained a \u201clitany of irrelevant and unsupported factual assertions.\u201d -AAP",

Some 24 years later, the reality is different \u2014 and it\u2019s not just the lack of videotape grain. The dancers, costume changes and dramatic entrances are all there, but the elaborate sets of two decades ago have been replaced by modern stage blocks and electronic visuals. Minogue enters the stage on a large swing, before starting the set in a mock diamond cage created by blue laser lighting. Opening with the lead single of her latest album and tour namesake, 2024\u2019sTension II, it sets us up for a night of the EDM-inspired sounds she has embraced with her latest releases. Eight dancers accompany Minogue with rigid and robotic movements, while metallic costuming and styling create a futuristic atmosphere. The past is never far from mind, however, as she dips into her older repertoire with brief versionsIn Your EyesandGet Outta My Way. The dancers take centre stage when Minogue exits the stage to swap a silver sequined dress for a red utility vest and baggy pants \u2014 the first of five costume changes. This ensemble also change colour and shape throughout the night, from sheer long sleeve tops and baggy pants with boater hats to colourful inflatable shapes that look like they could be characters in a children\u2019s television show. Throughout the set, Minogue strikes a careful balance between the new material and fans that have given her career a second \u2014 or perhaps fourth or fifth \u2014 wind, and the older hits that are baked into pop culture and childhood memories. It\u2019s clear that Minogue still holds a genuine love for these songs too \u2014 although it\u2019s hard to hold a candle to the passion of her fans. At one point, Minogue brings an overwhelmed fan on stage with her to have a hug and a private moment. Minogue makes her way to a small stage towards the back of the arena for some stripped back moments, offering fans roses and indulging requests from the audience with acapella snippets ofI Should Be So LuckyandPlease Stay.These moments give fans a moment to appreciate her voice free of the arena-filling electronic sounds that dominate the rest of the set. The volume returns when Minogue heads back to the mainstage for her the heavy bass drops and strobe lights of her club era, topped off with her Grammy-winning comeback hitPadam Padamwhich is rightfully given its moment in the spotlight. Padam Padammight have introduced her to new audiences, a simple \u201cLa la la\u201d is all fans need to be thrown back to 2001\u2019s chart-toppingCan\u2019t Get You Out of My Head. While the elaborate sets of past tours are gone \u2014 what artist could pull of aShowgirltour in the streaming age? \u2014Tensionlets Minogue\u2019s decades of experience and craft shine through. She is still the hardest working person on the stage for the duration of the two-hour set. For this fan, the years of waiting were worth it \u2014 even if, unlike VHS, you can\u2019t rewind and rewatch the real thing. Kylie Minogueis currently touring Australia with upcoming dates in Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney.",

For all my complaining, I\u2019m still alive,\u201d he said. \u201cI may be moaning that I can\u2019t walk but I look down the road and there\u2019s people that didn\u2019t do half as much as me and didn\u2019t make it.\u201d The July 5 concert is being billed as Black Sabbath\u2019s final show. It will top a line-up that also includes Metallica, Slayer, Pantera, Alice in Chains, Lamb Of God and Anthrax. The show\u2019s music director, Rage Against The Machine\u2019s Tom Morello, said: \u201cThis will be the greatest heavy metal show ever.\u201d However, he has refused to say if the night will feature any new music. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We haven\u2019t really talked about that. In fact, we haven\u2019t seen each other,\u201d Morello said. \u201cWe certainly haven\u2019t seen all of us together for a long time. I mean, I stay in touch with Oz and occasionally Geezer, but never Bill. So I don\u2019t even know what Bill does these days.\u201d Profits from the show, called Back to the Beginning, will be donated to charities including Cure Parkinson\u2019s.

        "raw_text": "Keith Urban first hit the streets of Tamworth as a nine-year-old busking in Peel Street. He\u2019d been building up to it since his dad noticed the kid had rhythm, so bought him a toy ukulele when he was four. Later, in 1979 in Tamworth, Keith saw Slim Dusty honoured on the Australian Country Music Hall of Fame\u2019s Roll of Renown. A million road miles and thousands of gigs later, Keith returned to Tamworth recently to receive the same award. The full circle moment wasn\u2019t wasted on him. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Urban tells me a few days later in Sydney. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s surreal to be on that rock [that serves as the honour board]. I think Slim was only the third or fourth guy to get a plaque on the rock, and there are over 50 people on that thing now. \u201cI remember when I was 10, or 11, and I stood in this long line of people waiting to get Slim\u2019s autograph. I\u2019d just bought the sheet music toLights on the Hilland worked my way up the line. I said, \u2018Hello, I\u2019m Keith, and he signed it for me\u2019. Twelve years later, I got to record that song with him as a duet, and go on tour with him.\u201d While Tamworth is crucial to Urban\u2019s story, so is Brisbane. It\u2019s one of the cities on his Australian tour in August. He\u2019ll kick that off in Newcastle on August 13 before playing Brisbane, Wollongong, Sydney and Melbourne before winding up with a show in Adelaide on August 28. Brisbane is the city where Urban learnt his craft and paid his bills playing in cover bands while trying to build a fan base for his original music. A lucky few hundred fans were given a taste of that apprenticeship when Urban recently played a club show at Lefty\u2019s Music Hall in Brisbane to promote his widely acclaimed new album, High. More used to playing arenas these days, a club show that size was a time warp. So much so that by the time the concert had hit the 2\u00bd-hour mark, the audience had reverted to \u201980s pub mode and were calling out for covers by The Angels and Cold Chisel. Urban obliged. \u201cAussie crowds are no BS,\u201d Urban says. \u201cIf you sucked back then, they\u2019d let you know. But equally, if they liked you, you\u2019d know that too. In hindsight, it was a great way to grow up, because it was a brutally honest environment. There was no filter. \u201cI remember back then thinking, Oh God, if I just had one song that they knew the words to, it would be the most amazing feeling. But it was like, Oh well, let\u2019s doApril Sun in Cubaagain. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you the good part about that \u2013 you learn a lot playing those covers in pubs. You\u2019re always asking yourself, why does this song work? Why does this one really work? Which part of that song just kills it? And you start to sense these patterns in writing, melodic structure and other various things. \u201cI think The Beatles had that with all the years playing in Hamburg. It\u2019s the same thing. It really gives you good bones as a musician.\u201d Urban worked on his craft and became so popular after moving to Nashville that his name started popping up on records made by everyone from the Dixie Chicks to Garth Brooks. After a metaphorical long march, the great leap forward finally happened. An international star now, Urban hit the big time when he cracked the American charts. The rest of the world complied. Urban\u2019s own albums started to soar and a string of No.1 and top five records followed the release of theGolden Roadalbum in 2002. With more hit singles than you can poke a stick at, Urban has collaborated with everyone from Amy Shark to Taylor Swift. As for his guitar playing, scroll through YouTube and you\u2019ll find him jamming alongside everyone from Peter Frampton to The Rolling Stones. Right now, he\u2019s rehearsing a new band and is gearing up to tourHighacross Australia in August, dubbed High and Alive. \u201cI like the dark humour of the title in relation to my past,\u201d he says ofHigh. \u201cI know it\u2019s jarring for some people to even think of the word humour when it comes to addiction, but I like people doing whatever they want to do at my concerts. I\u2019ve been sober for a long time. Just get in the zone and let\u2019s have a great time.\u201d More informationhere This article first appeared inInReview. Read the originalhere",

        "raw_text": "There are two verses toAdvance Australia Fair, but do you know the second? Probably not. It\u2019s in our citizenship booklet,Our Common Bond, suggesting Aussies know it and new citizens could be questioned on it in their citizenship test. Yetofficial protocolmakes singing it optional. And who\u2019ll choose to sing both verses when thousands of sporting fans just want the game to start? There are living generations who never properly learntAdvance Australia Fair. Before 1984,most school studentssangGod Save the Queen. Schools today teach verse one, but whether we learn verse two is haphazard. If school students sing along to a pre-recorded accompaniment with two verses, we\u2019ll learn verse two. If we sing along with a squeaking school beginner band, one verse is probably all we\u2019ll endure. I suspect if we knew the second verse our common bond would be arguing about it. Australiansacted passionatelywhen debating one word in verse one, yet verse two barely raises an eyebrow. It\u2019s the controversy we need to have (after we\u2019ve googled the lyrics). The problem with verse two comes from its origins. It wasn\u2019t in Peter Dodds McCormick\u2019s original 1878 composition. Hissecond versechampioned gallant Cook sailing with British courage to raise old England\u2019s flag, proving \u201cBritannia rules the waves\u201d. His third and fourth verses weren\u2019t any more appropriate. So, beforeAdvance Australia Fairbecame our anthem in 1984, the National Australia Day Council made shrewd edits. Instead of using verse two from McCormick\u2019s original version, they turned toanother version ofAdvance Australia Fairwritten for federation in 1901. The federation version introduced a new commemorative verse, the only other verse the council kept: Beneath our radiant Southern Cross we\u2019ll toil with hearts and handsTo make our youthful Commonwealth renowned of all the landsFor loyal sons beyond the seas we\u2019ve boundless plains to shareWith courage let us all combine to Advance Australia Fair. Next, the council fixed the gendered language in the federation verse. \u201cLoyal sons\u201d became \u201cthose who\u2019ve come\u201d. They deleted \u201cyouthful\u201d with an uncanny premonition that age would become sensitive. (For verse one, Australians resolved the debate ingeniously in 2021by replacing\u201cyoung and free\u201d with \u201cone and free\u201d.) But that\u2019s all the council changed in verse two. They endorsed the rest. The federation verse, understandably, celebrated the politics of 1901. The lyrics begin mildly but repetitively, \u201cBeneath our radiant Southern Cross we\u2019ll toil with hearts and hands\u201d. I\u2019m not sure why we\u2019re toiling in both verses. Perhaps Aussies have an exceptional work ethic. In the next line, the word \u201ccommonwealth\u201d was included to mark federation. The forming of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901 marked a transition from six British colonies (New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland) into one nation. On one hand, it celebrates unity and cooperation between colonies. But by singing the intended meaning of the verse, that the nation began when the colonies united, we disrespect the knowledge Australia already was many nations of First Peoples. In 1901, Australia\u2019s idea of sharing land was specific. We recruited enthusiastically for more British immigration, yet rejected migrants who weren\u2019t white. The Immigration Restriction Act 1901, one of our parliament\u2019s first laws, allowed immigration officers to set near impossible dictation tests in any European language. In effect, this meant anyone could be excluded from immigrating by what would be known as the White Australia Policy. Australia\u2019s 21st century approach to sharing with foreigners also draws media attention. The breach of human rights atdetention centresand the limiting ofinternational student visasto stem migration suggest we have \u201cbounds\u201d after all. If the federation verse is theoretically testable for new citizens, then we should check if the values of 1901 and 2025 still match. Without checking, Australia is stagnating, not advancing. The way forward is in the last line of verse two: \u201cWith courage let us all combine to Advance Australia Fair\u201d. In 1901, that was a plea for spirit and cooperation between colonies when forming a national parliament. Yet, there\u2019s a timeless truth in those words. By debating our anthem courageously, we can be united by challenge, enriched by diversity and ingenious at rewriting lyrics.

        "raw_text": "I can remember the mixed feelings I experienced as a teenager in 1997, buyingLife Thru A Lens\u2013 my firstRobbie Williamsalbum \u2013 cautious it was too poppy to sit with my humble-but-growing CD collection of artists that would later be known asBritpop. Yet, the album\u2019s inherent cheekiness combined with moments of vulnerability made it something I was comfortable to include as part of the soundtrack to my adolescent life. I was reminded of these feelings watchingBetter Man, directorMichael Gracey\u2019snew biopic musical that charts the story of the Williams\u2019 journey to superstardom, along with his self-consciousness regarding where he fits as an artist and person. The singer-songwriter is present throughout the film, albeit off-screen in the form of the narrator, guiding us through his history: growing up in Stoke-on-Trent, the son of divorced parents, his joining and dismissal from boy band Take That, the reckless partying, his brief relationship with Nicole Appleton, and his own solo career. There is often a brutal honesty in these events, where no one (including Williams) comes off particularly well. Insecurity, the search for self-authenticity and the desire for acceptance are the three elements that fuel the film. \u201cRobbie became a character, something I could hide behind,\u201d says Williams the narrator, offering some rationale for the CGI monkey used to portray the artist. In case you\u2019ve missed the publicity, Williams is \u201cplayed\u201d by actor Jonno Davies, but in a computerised twist, special visual effects present the performer as a CGI walking-talking-singing-dancing simian. Williams as chimpanzee is a stylisation choice which seemingly goes unnoticed by other human characters inBetter Man. The film is not attempting a sci-fi tone like 2017\u2019sWar for the Planet of the Apes, but to my surprise makes much better use of CGI precisely for that reason. These visual effects serve to remind the viewer of the pure artifice of the music industry and how fabricated identity \u2013 particularly that of performers who have no direct control over it \u2013 can take its toll. According to Hollywood industry magazineVariety,William\u2019s descriptionof himself as a performing monkey is what inspired Gracey\u2019s aesthetic choice. However, I wonder if there is also some nod to the2008 media reportsof Williams walking around Los Angeles disguised in a gorilla suit after a three-month period of isolation. Like the suit, or even Damon Albarn\u2019s virtual band,Gorillaz, the chimpanzee avatar provides a liminal role that keeps the performer present and absent at the same time. This is a theme that the film attempts to deal with in both content and form, emphasised through the performer\u2019s off-screen narration. This fragmented, entertainment-led construction of identity is also a continuation of themes explored in Hugh Jackman\u2019sThe Greatest Showman, also directed by Gracey. Better Man, unlike Gracey\u2019s earlier film however, strives (in the script at least) for grittier realism, with expletive language from the beginning. This is not a film for young fans, who might anyway only be tangentially aware of Williams through a different animal in Robin Shaw\u2019s adaptation ofThe Tiger Who Came to Tea, in which the singer provided the central song. What I found particularly engaging about the film is the ordinariness and honesty of Williams. He doesn\u2019t claim to be overly talented, but is rather someone who owes his initial fame to his cheeky-chappy persona, often presented as a coping mechanism for dealing with rejection. The film indicates how his desire for attention is presented as the result of the singer\u2019s sometime-absent father, Pete Conway (Steve Pemberton), a struggling performer who lives for the stage but never quite made it. The young simian is left to contemplate his father\u2019s mantra \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re either a somebody or a nobody\u201d \u2013 which cues some tender moments with his grandmother Betty (Alison Steadman), presented as one of the most positive relationships in his early life. Imagery of Williams and Betty at home together on the sofa, embraced in the television glow of comedy showThe Two Ronniesgives the film a sense of nostalgia. But the unhealthy and unrealistic reverence that goes with global stardom is also presented as a damaging experience that precedes the star\u2019s drug addiction and isolation. These themes are something of a far cry from your average musical film. Characters spontaneously break into song (Take That or Robbie Williams tracks) in addition to scenes that focus on rehearsals and show performances, sharply reminding us of the constructed reality of pop-star life. The film\u2019s strength lies in portraying the veneer of stratospheric success that masks the human insecurity just below the surface, encapsulated by the CGI monkey modelled on the features of both Williams and actor Jonno Davies. For me, this was one of the best reasons to see it, but if you need more, there is a huge playlist of familiar tracks, including a spectacular high-octane montage ofRock DJ. Go seeBetter Manand let it entertain you. Daniel O\u2019Brien, Lecturer, Department of Literature Film and Theatre Studies,University of Essex.",

        "raw_text": "Veteran rock star Rod Stewart will join some storied octogenarians when he takes to the stage in front of thousands of fans at the Glastonbury music festival next year. On Tuesday it was announced thatStewart will play the Glastonbury legends slot on the Pyramid stage next year after headlining the festival in 2002. Stewart will turn 80 before his festival appearance, making him a a member of a select and small group of 80-plus artists. Paul McCartney\u00a0was 80\u00a0when he performed at the festival in 2022, while the late Burt Bacharachwas 87 when he took the stage in 2015. Glastonbury festival organiser Emily Eavis said in a post on Instagram: \u201cBringing Sir Rod Stewart back for the Sunday afternoon slot on the Pyramid stage is everything we could wish for. \u201cWhat a way to bow out with the final legends slot before we take a fallow year. We cannot wait!\u201d The legends slot has become a showcase for some of the biggest names in rock gone by, giving veteran performers a chance to greet new audiences, as well as throngs of fast-aging fans. Previous big names to grace to perform in recent years include \u00a0Yusef / Cat Stevens, Shania Twain, Diana Ross, Dolly Parton, Tom Jones, Tony Bennett and James Brown. Stewart, though, will be the first artist to have headlined both the festival and the legend slot. Stewart has been performing steadily for more than 60 years, including stints in Las Vegas in recent years and a tour of the the UK with Boy George last year. But for those prepared to make the trip to the UK for Glastonbury it could be their last chance to see the rock great perform live. Last week, Stewart announced he will end \u201clarge-scale world tours\u201d, while stopping short of announcing his retirement. \u201cThis will be the end of large-scale world tours for me, but I have no desire to retire,\u201d he said in an Instagram post. \u201cI love what I do, and I do what I love. I\u2019m fit, have a full head of hair, and can run 100 metres in 18 seconds at the jolly old age of 79,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to move onto aGreat American Songbook, Swing Fevertour the year after next \u2013 smaller venues and more intimacy. But then again, I may not\u2026\u201d The post was signed \u201cThe Ambiguous Sir Rod Stewart\u201d. Known for his distinctive raspy singing voice,Stewart is one thebest-selling music artistsof all time, having sold more than 120 million records worldwide. He took up busking with a harmonica in 1962 before joining the Dimensions as a vocalist in 1963 as a vocalist. He went on to perform with Long John Baldry\u00a0and the\u00a0All Stars, the Jeff Beck Group and Faces through the 60s before launching a massively successful solo career.",

        "raw_text": "The federal government has proposed an additional tax of 15 per cent on the earnings made on super balances of over $3 million,the so-called Division 296 tax. This has set off a highly politicised debate that has often shed more heat than light. Yet back in 2009,the wide-ranging Henry Reviewof the tax system cogently identified the three main problems with the super tax system and recommended reforms to fix them. Its recommendations, after some updating, are a better, more comprehensive solution than the controversial Division 296 tax. The three problems are: It is critical to properly address these problems with how super is taxed because Australiansnow have a massive $4.1 trillion in superannuation savings. Let us look at the main Henry Review recommendations and then see how the proposed Division 296 tax stacks up. Unlike some systems, ours does not tax super pension payments, so the two key issues are how we tax contributions and earnings. Employers pay workers in two ways. First, they directly pay a cash salary that is taxed under a progressive income tax scale. The effective marginal tax rates, including the Medicare levy, rise in steps with income from 18 per cent through to 32 per cent (for the average wage-earner), 39 per cent and 47 per cent. Second, employers pay a contribution on workers\u2019 behalf into their superannuation fund. From July 1, under thesuperannuation guarantee charge(SGC), this contribution will rise to 12 per cent of cash salary. The contribution is taxed at a flat 15 per cent when it is made into a fund, regardless of what income tax bracket the worker is in. The way contributions are taxed is a massive concession for high-income earners. They pay 47 per cent tax on additional cash salary \u2013 but only 15 per cent on their super contributions. In contrast, low-income earners receive a tiny concession because the contributions tax rate of 15 per cent is only just below their usual effective marginal tax rate of 18 per cent. The Henry Review recommended that instead, everyone should receive the same rate of tax concession as the average wage-earner. This is how that idea would work today. First, super contributions would be taxed in the hands of employees alongside their cash salary, rather than being deducted by the super fund as is currently the case. Second, everyone would receive the same tax offset calculated as 17 per cent of their contributions as their super tax concession. One side effect of this Henry recommendation is that the average wage-earner would pay the 15 per cent contributions tax out of their own pocket, instead of the super fund paying it on the member\u2019s behalf. However, this loss of cash income can be avoided by tweaking the Henry recommendation. Under my modified recommendation, the superannuation guarantee rate would be reduced to 10 per cent, employers would be encouraged to fully pass on their savings from this by increasing wages by 1.8 per cent, and the tax offset rate would be lifted to 20 per cent. These policy settings would maintain both cash incomes and super balances for the average wage earner. In accumulation mode, the current system taxes fund earnings at 15 per cent, with a lower effective rate of 10 per cent on capital gains. However, after you retire and your account changes from accumulation mode to pension mode, the tax on earnings stops and your pension benefits are also tax-free. The Henry Review recommended that earnings should continue to be taxed in pension mode in the same way as in accumulation mode. That way, retirees make a contribution to income tax revenue, which is important with an ageing population. A uniform earnings tax would also simplify what is an overly complex super tax system. The Henry Review also recommended the earnings tax rate be reduced to 7.5 per cent because long-term saving through superannuation is desirable. However, that proposal is probably unaffordable today because of the budget deficit. The proposed Division 296 tax further complicates the tax system by introducing a third treatment for earnings, whereas the Henry Review simplifies the system with a uniform earnings tax. The complexities of Division 296 can be seen from the 304-pageexplanatory memorandum. The new tax also raises less revenue than the Henry Review recommendations yet we are experiencing a structural budget deficit. The new tax is moreopen to avoidancethan the Henry recommendations. The new tax also does nothing to address the problem that tax concessions for contributions are heavily skewed to high-income earners. Taxing unrealised capital gains under the new tax may cause financial hardship for some retirees who are asset rich but income poor. The $3 million threshold for the new tax isnot indexed, unlike all of the other super tax system thresholds. Overall, the proposed Division 296 tax is best seen as a rough attempt to counteract past policy errors that allowed excessive contributions into super. The federal government should first address the main problems with the super tax system by implementing the Henry Review recommendations, suitably updated. Then, a considerably reworked Division 296 tax could potentially play a useful supporting role.

        "raw_text": "After decades of early mornings, late nights and endless paperwork, Australia\u2019sBaby Boomer business ownersare finally asking: \u201cWhat now?\u201d They built businesses in the 1980s and \u201990s \u2013 back when marketing meant a fax blast and Google was still just a big number. These Boomers have powered the economy one sandwich shop, dry cleaner, and ute-load of plumbing supplies at a time. But now, Boomers are in their 60s and 70s, and face the final act of their working life. While employees tend to retire in their mid- to late-60s, business owners tend to hang around for longer. Looking at all members of the workforce, once we surpass the age of 75, more than half of workers are business owners. Spoiler alert: a surprising number of Boomer business owners have no idea what comes next. Global datasuggest that around 70 per cent of family businesses have no formal succession strategy. None. Nada. For many, planning for the end of their business is like writing their own obituary \u2014 too grim, too soon, and definitely not a fun Sunday afternoon activity. And yet, time is marching on. The knees are creakier. The early starts feel earlier. That third coffee doesn\u2019t hit quite like it used to. Boomers aren\u2019t just running businesses anymore \u2014 they\u2019re running out of reasons not to retire. Some have dreams of passing the reins to the kids. But the kids have other dreams \u2013 most of them involve tech startups, kombucha, and working from anywherebutthe family shop. So, many Boomers pivot to Plan B \u2013 sell the business. And if no buyer shows up? Plan C: quietly shut the doors. There is now a glut of small businesses hitting the market, but not nearly enough buyers with the cash, courage, or caffeine tolerance to take them on. It\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market \u2013 and for many, it\u2019s more a \u201cclosing down sale\u201d than a \u201cgolden handshake.\u201d But here\u2019s where things get interesting: more and more Boomer business owners are thinking about legacy. Not just a nice payout, but leaving something behind thatmatters. Something their name can stay attached to, even if their daily involvement ends with an afternoon nap and a round of golf. Some explore employee ownership schemes. Others mentor younger entrepreneurs. A few even morph their businesses into social enterprises \u2013 because if you\u2019ve survived 30 years of BAS statements, you can probably handle a governance board too. This isn\u2019t just a business story \u2013 in regional Australia, it\u2019s a community one. Out there, the retiring Boomer isn\u2019t just a business owner \u2013 theyarethe local newsagent, the hardware store, the only person who knows how to fix the old tractor. When they go, whole communities feel the loss. The most extreme example might be GPs who keep their clinic open well into their 70s simply because they find closing down would be an inexcusable hit for the local community. The next decade, then, is less about retiring and more about reshaping. Boomers are slowly shifting roles \u2014 from boss to mentor, from owner to advisor, from the one doing everything to the one who (finally) gets to say, \u201cthat\u2019s someone else\u2019s problem now\u201d. Many Boomers, especially in knowledge-driven businesses, won\u2019tfullyretire. They\u2019ll just scale back, trim their hours and still \u201cpop in\u201d every second day to make sure the new team isn\u2019t wrecking the joint. Letting go is hard when the jointisyou, when the business itself is the legacy. Just how big is the issue of losing Baby Boomer owned businesses? Quite large as it turns out. The 2021 Census provides us with detailed information about 12 million people that make up the Australian workforce (that number rose to over 14 million by now). Over 10.1 million Australians work as employees for someone else\u2019s business or organisation. Almost 1.7 million Australians are their own boss. Almost one million of these business owners are sole traders, meaning they don\u2019t employ any staff and manage their business by themselves (maybe with the occasional unofficial help of a spouse or family member). This leaves 695,000 Australians who own and manage a business that employs at least one staff member. Many industries rely on sole traders to fill employment gaps, have a look how many sole traders your industry is likely to lose in the coming decade. We are looking at a concept again that I introducedin an earlier column, the retirement cliff. We measure what share of workers are already of retirement age (65+) and what share is nearing retirement age \u2013 meaning they are 55-64 years old and will fall of the proverbial retirement cliff in about a decade. Remember that we are basing our analysis on Census data from 2021 \u2013 by now the issue is already much more pressing. As the chart below shows, the looming lack of sole traders will hit Agriculture really hard. Expect endless farm mergers and much more mechanisation to counter that trend. Industries towards the top of the chart are well advised to heavily invest into AI, automation, and robotics now to soften the blow. Will we be able to encourage enough new talent to fill the gaps the retiring sole trader Boomers leave behind? Sole trader businesses often don\u2019t lend themselves to being sold. A tradie running their own business might be able to sell of tools and machinery but it\u2019s unclear how valuable their client database might be to a younger tradie trying to become their own boss. This is a very different story when we look at businesses that employ staff. Often those businesses have intrinsic value attractive to prospective buyers. On the top of the chart, we see a common story of farmers not being able to keep the business within the family because the kids have other career plans.Farmers then hold on to the business for as long as they can stomach the hard physical tasks. Eventually these family farms get sold and consolidated. This means fewer workers are needed to get the same (or better) yield. In the process small farming communities see an outflow of population and bit by bit certain services become financially unviable. Slowly the lifeblood gets sucked out of these communities unless new populations are attracted to the area. This trend needn\u2019t be a depressing story. For younger (prospective) business owners this is a decade of big opportunities. If you own a business already, buy up Baby Boomer businesses like there is no tomorrow. Of course, due diligence still matters \u2013 but the opportunities are real. Increase your market share. As time goes on, more low-ball offers will be successful as Baby Boomers become increasingly keen to part with their business. This truly is the golden decade for business brokers. As Baby Boomer business owners edge toward retirement, it\u2019s time to start asking some hard questions about succession. Many of these businesses were built from scratch\u2013 some before the Internet was even a thing \u2013 and now risk vanishing simply because there\u2019s no formal plan in place. Family Business Australia reckons around 70 per cent of family firms lack a documented succession strategy. That\u2019s not just a missed opportunity; it\u2019s an economic risk, especially in regional Australia where these businesses often anchor local communities. But there\u2019s also a silver lining here. Younger entrepreneurs \u2013 tech-savvy, purpose-driven, and full of ideas \u2013 stand ready to take the reins. With the right handover, we could see these businesses thrive for another generation. That future just needs a bit of planning today. Simon Kuestenmacher is a co-founder of The Demographics Group.

Treasury analysed the impacts of Cyclone Alfred, and floods across NSW and Queensland, finding that partial data for the March quarter showed natural disasters have hit retail trade and household spending particularly hard. The $2.2 billion figure is based on Treasury\u2019s initial assessment at the time of the disasters and there may be rebuilding activity in future quarters. Most of the overall immediate loss in economic activity is expected to be felt in the March quarter. It will be seen in the March quarter National Accounts, to be released on Wednesday. Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the government\u2019s first priority was helping fund recovery and rebuilding for communities. \u201cThe human impacts matter to us most but the economic cost is very significant too and we\u2019ll see that in Wednesday\u2019s national accounts,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of the progress Australians have made together in the economy, with inflation down, debt down and unemployment low, we\u2019re in a stronger position to provide support when communities need it most.\u201d Nominal retail trade in Queensland fell 0.3 per cent in February and 0.4 per cent in March. In volumes terms, the ABS Monthly Household Spending Indicator was flat in the March quarter. The 0.2 per cent fall in Queensland was a contributor to this flat result. Flooding in NSW in late May, from the Hunter to the mid-north coast, has left 10,000 homes and businesses damaged or destroyed, and the Insurance Council of Australia reported more than 6000 insurance claims. In early March, Tropical Cyclone Alfred crossed the coast on Moreton Island, and subsequently caused widespread damage and flooding to communities across south-east Queensland and northern NSW. Prolonged downpours in south-west and central Queensland in late March and early April flooded a vast area spanning about one million square kilometres. The government\u2019sDisaster Assistwebsite lists 27 separate natural disasters from January-May, consisting of flooding, storms, cyclones and bushfires. Opposition Leader Sussan Ley was on the NSW mid-north coast on Monday to visit flood-affected communities with local MPs. Emergency Management Minister Kristy McBain said the government was funding measures to increase resilience, adaptability and preparedness, and the Disaster Ready Fund initiative would provide another $200 million 2025-26. \u201cI have recently been on the ground in NSW seeing first-hand the effects a disaster can have, and it is my priority to work closely with all levels of government to ensure support is provided as quickly as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have activated multiple disaster payments and we will continue to work with NSW on any other funding requests and I have been meeting with small business and primary producers who have been hit hard.\u201d -AAP",

This has the following main advantages:  Hi Craig, I am reviewing my super fund. I have been with Media Super but am uncomfortable with the merger with CBUS. I see that ASIC has sued CBUS over delays in paying death and disability claims. If compensation and fines are to be paid, where does the money come from to pay it? Does it eat into member profits? I have used the Unisuper and ATO websites for a fund comparison between the ART, CBUS and Unisuper growth funds and the results don\u2019t match up. Should they give the same results? Some financial commentators say a large super balance can be more expensive to keep in a fund due to fees being a percentage of the balance. They sometimes suggest a Wrap or SMSF once super is over a certain balance. But for now I am looking for a fund that gives the best returns with low fees and, hopefully, an income stream tax refund on setting up a pension fund. I note that Unisuper does not give members the tax refund or bonus. I am a couple of years off setting up a pension fund. Yes, unfortunately there have been funds that have provided very poor service in relation to processing death benefit claims and other service-related issues. As you point out, CBUS is one of those funds identified and Media Super recently merged into CBUS. These funds have grown so fast that their level of service hasn\u2019t kept up. Historically they focused on the two things you identified, good returns and low fees. Now that they are on the regulator\u2019s radar, you would expect them to put more focus on customer service. In relation to fines, the funds would have to pay this from their operation reserves \u2013 which most likely ends up being funded from members. The funds you have nominated have all performed well, have low fees and are well-rated by research groups like SuperRatings and Chant West. The ATO Super-comparator tool is a good place to start, then you can use comparator websites. Note that ASIC\u2019sMoneysmarthas tips on using these. Funds have different fee schedules. Some charge flat fees and others include percentage-based fees; this is more common when you get into a pension. Industry funds are very competitive on fees and you would need a substantial amount of funds and low-fee underlying investments to getter a better deal. A retirement bonus is one factor to consider. However, there are many others. Different super funds have different tax arrangements. My understanding is that UniSuper shares the potential tax savings from people moving to pension across all super members. You\u2019ve likely benefited from this approach over your time as member, rather than having a lump sum at the end. Hi Craig, I have $30,000 left in a bring-forward non-concessional contribution arrangement that I want to take up. I also have the regular $30,000 concessional contribution cap. I want to contribute a combined $60,000 this year. However, I will only need to claim tax rebate for a portion of the concessional contribution. Is this OK, or, am I obliged to claim the full amount contributed under concessional contribution cap? Thanks and kind regards, George Hi George, it\u2019s entirely up to you. Yes, you can contribute $60,000 to super and claim $30,000 as a tax deduction. Claiming it as a deduction makes it a \u201cconcessional contribution\u201d. The other $30,000 would be a non-concessional and complete your bring forward contribution.

        "raw_text": "From the door of Mel Connell\u2019s gift shop, in shin-deep water, the only things still recognisable were a few hanging festoon and fairy lights. After 14 years as a small retailer, she had to refashion her premises after floods ripped through the northern NSW town of Lismore in February 2022. By September, Connell had reopened with $50 in her pocket and an unfinished building. She was thousands more short in products and equipment. Three years later, she still feels the impact. \u201cIt\u2019s been an extremely hard slog, I\u2019m never doing that again,\u201d Ms Connell said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a business, my partner also has a job here, we\u2019ve got a home loan. We can\u2019t just pack up and leave.\u201d Every time it rains heavily, she \u201cfreaks out\u201d. \u201cPeople died here and we had a billion-dollar emergency, so I just wish the government would actually have some kind of plan in place to help us in the future.\u201d Tensions are high across the state\u2019s mid north coast and Hunter regions with more than a thousand properties uninhabitable and dozens more beyond repair. Insurance premiums have skyrocketed, with residents launching GoFundMe efforts to help salvage inundated homes. The Fitzgerald family in Taree had to set one up after insurers declined to cover them after they were flooded for a first time. \u201cWhen the second flood struck, they were left with absolutely nothing,\u201d says campaign organiser Sharon Revell. \u201cTo make matters even more heartbreaking, the boys recently lost their beloved mum to terminal cancer. \u201cHer passing has left three sons, one of whom lives with a disability, without their home, their stability and their mother.\u201d Elsewhere, GoFundMe organisers say insurance premiums for another second-time victim jumped four times their original cost following NSW floods in March 2021. About 1.36 million properties are at any time at risk of flooding across the state and in Victoria and Queensland, according to the Insurance Council of Australia. In Lismore, Connell wants to see infrastructure built to withstand future events after 2022 triggered an exodus of residents. \u201cPeople would reinvest into the town and not just our town, everywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had eight years with floods, we\u2019re trying to get the town back on its feet and it would bring positivity back. \u201cIt would be life-changing for a lot of people and having some kind of \u2026 solution so they don\u2019t leave the postcode and can still purchase a property out of the flood zone would contribute to the economy here.\u201d There may be light at the end of the tunnel for residents and business owners with the insurance council calling for government and the sector to establish a $30 billion dollar fund to protect flood-prone communities. In a report issued prior to the federal election, it urged the building more flood defence infrastructure, buying-back properties and strengthening others in harm\u2019s way. \u201cThere is a solution. It\u2019s going to be a public-private partnership between government and insurers,\u201d the council\u2019s executive director Andrew Hall told Sydney radio station 2GB this week. \u201cThere are 220,000 homes on the east coast of Australia that are sitting in a two or five per cent chance of flooding every year. \u201cWe\u2019ve priced the de-risking of 24 catchments on the east coast over a period of 10 years.\u201d However in Taree, a community which has been decimated by the recent floods, Mayor Claire Pontin says council looked at constructing higher levees but the cost outweighed the benefit. \u201cHad we built those levees back then, this flood would have gone over the top of them anyway,\u201d she says. \u201cAll those issues about flood mitigation works to try and make our assets, and the community\u2019s assets, more resilient to flooding is on the table.\u201d Inflated insurance premiums have become a recurring conversation with flood affected victims. Last year, residents told of being forced to endure unreasonable wait times and being overcharged by insurers to an inquiry into flood failures. One claimed to have been left in the lurch for 18 months. \u201cI am emotionally exhausted, I lost all my belongings,\u201d they said in a submission. \u201cI have tried to obtain online quotes from other insurers and they are either exorbitant or they refuse to insure in our area. \u201cWe applied for a buyback of the property through the resilient homes fund but have been rejected, despite having six properties surrounding us that have been bought back and in the process of being demolished.\u201d The NSW Department of Planning is in the throes of responding to inquiry recommendations following the 2022 floods. \u201cThe government is stopping inappropriate developments on dangerous floodplains,\u201d according to a spokesperson. \u201cTo proactively plan and mitigate against the impacts of floods in NSW, the Department is taking a risk-based approach to planning decisions on dangerous flood plains.\u201d Queensland\u2019s Department of Infrastructure says it has been liaising with other agencies on policy. \u201cKey actions such as natural hazard mapping (has been) undertaken across the state and each local government area implements their own flood risk mapping tools for Queenslanders to utilise and check risk for personal safety and property,\u201d a spokesperson says. \u201cThe department continues to work closely with various other agencies and local councils responsible for navigating the state\u2019s preparedness for natural hazards, risk and resilience, particularly when it comes to land use.\u201d About 300,000 people lodged claims with insurance companies after the 2022 NSW floods, with the state and Commonwealth committing more than $3.5 billion for recovery. Assistant federal treasurer Daniel Mulino says some insurers have been too slow to clean up devastated communities. \u201c(About) 90 to 95 per cent of claims are resolved within a year or so but that still leaves a very large number of claims hanging on,\u201d he this week told ABC Radio. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in a number of instances, hundreds and sometimes thousands of people with still unresolved claims a year or even two years after the disaster.\u201d Some 6000 people currently have claims lodged with the insurance council. Applications opened on Friday for commonwealth-state payments to help cover costs for items including food, clothing, medication and emergency accommodation. -AAP",

        "raw_text": "It didn\u2019t take long for social media to jump on to US President Donald Trump\u2019s latest, unedifying nickname. Earlier this month,Financial Timescolumnist Robert Armstrong coined an acronym to describe a popular trading strategy centred around Trump\u2019s start-and-stop tariff policies \u2013 TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out). Introduced to this moniker at a media conference on Thursday Australian time, the President was not happy. Asked what he thought of the term, Trump said he was unaware of it. \u201cI chicken out? Oh, I\u2019ve never heard that. You mean because I reduced China from 145 per cent that I set down to 100 and then to another number?\u201d he said, referring to tariff rates he imposed on imported Chinese goods. The tariff rate for China is now 30 per cent. Last week, Trump threatened to impose 50 per cent tariffs on goods from the European Union on June 1, causing shares to slide. \u201cYou call that chickening out?\u201d\u00a0 Trump said.\u201cIt\u2019s called negotiation.\u201d He admitted part of his tactic included setting \u201ca ridiculous high number\u201d for tariff rates and going down if he got other nations to give in to his demands. \u201cDon\u2019t ever say what you said,\u201d he said, calling it \u201cthe nastiest question\u201d. Nasty or not, it has certainly inspired social media posters to generate a slew of mocking online memes. According to a note to subscribers on Thursday from respected Wall Street market analyst Tom Essaye, the answer is yes. In the note, theSevens Report Researchfounder pointed to Trump\u2019s decision to exempt goods subject to the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement from additional tariffs on Mexico and Canada, significantly reducing their sting. He also noted Trump postponed all \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs against US trading partners just a week after his market-shaking \u201cliberation day\u201d announcement on April 2. \u201cThe returns are somewhat conclusive: The TACO trade has worked and buying stocks on extreme tariff-related threats has worked,\u201d Essaye wrote. Sharemarket investors aren\u2019t the only ones taking note of Trump\u2019s apparent TACO tendencies. On Wednesday, Russian state propagandists mocked the President for lacking any follow through, predicting in a tweet that Trump\u2019s \u201cplaying with fire\u201d threat would be reversed by a social media post the following morning.",

        "raw_text": "Ah, the Nationals are at it again \u2013 insisting on a policy that is against the interests of Australians living in regional and remote areas. Forced divestiture of stores by supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths could only lead to higher grocery prices in locations where the cost of transportation is high. You don\u2019t need to take my word for it \u2013 although I conducted a full review of the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct, all of whose recommendations were accepted by the Albanese government and are being implemented. My report rejected forced divestiture as a penalty for anti-competitive conduct, as has Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Rather, I recommended maximum penalties for major breaches of the mandatory code of conduct of $10 million, 10 per cent of annual turnover or three times the benefit gained, whichever is the greatest. But the Greens teamed up with the Coalition and sought to legislate forced divestiture. A decision to order divestment of stores would be for the courts, not for the government of the day or the ACCC. That\u2019s because of the separation of powers between the government and the courts, as required by the Constitution. Coles and Woolworths dominate the Australian supermarket industry. Aldi and wholesaler Metcash \u2013 which supplies IGA stores \u2013 are much smaller players. A court contemplating forcing Coles or Woolworths to sell some of its stores would ask the obvious question \u2013 who would be the prospective buyer? How would forcing Coles to sell to Woolworths, or Woolworths to Coles, fix anything? It certainly wouldn\u2019t increase competition. Advocates of forced divestiture argue Coles or Woolworths would be required to offload stores to a foreign buyer. But who says foreign supermarket chains would be interested? There\u2019s no law stopping them from entering the market now, but for better or worse, richer or poorer, they are staying away in droves. Maybe they just can\u2019t see the sense in starting up a supermarket chain in Australia, far from their home base in America or Europe? Perhaps an email from a court inviting them to Australia would do the trick, but probably not. It\u2019s true that German company Aldi moved into Australia at the turn of the century and is still here, and expanding its footprint. Maybe Coles or Woolworths could be ordered to sell some of their stores to Aldi? But Aldi has a smaller range of items than Coles and Woolworths. It is a popular chain, but many shoppers don\u2019t buy exclusively from Aldi, going instead to Coles or Woolworths to complete their weekly shopping. If Aldi wants to expand its store footprint but is being held back by restrictive state and local planning and zoning laws, those restrictions should be relaxed. Overly restrictive, anti-competitive planning and zoning laws are definitely on the Albanese government\u2019s competition policy agenda. IGA stores offer convenience and personal service, but also have a more limited range and on average are more expensive than the large supermarket chains. The biggest losers from the Nationals-Liberals-Greens forced divestiture policy would be people living in regional and remote Australia. The major supermarkets have uniform pricing policies for non-perishable items. And even for perishable fruit and vegetables and meat and fish, they can have uniform pricing for an entire state. Effectively, Coles and Woolworths shoppers in the big cities are subsidising those living in regional and remote areas, where transport costs are much greater. The ACCC\u2019s February 2025 report of its inquiry into supermarkets, having examined the uniform pricing policies of Coles and Woolworths, found that: \u201cPrices actually paid by consumers are broadly consistent with the pricing policies the supermarkets have outlined\u201d. It follows that if there was forced divestiture of the local Coles or Woolworths supermarket in a regional or remote location, shoppers in these places would be obliged to pay higher prices for their groceries, owing to higher transport costs. They no longer would benefit from the subsidies paid by their city cousins. Shire leaders in the Kimberley region of Western Australia have expressed concern about forced divestiture. Shire president Chris Mitchell said smaller retailers would find it difficult to keep the shelves filled amid high demand if bigger supermarkets were sold off. He is smarter than the average mayor, Boo Boo! The Albanese government has announced it will ensure the costs of 30 essential products in more than 76 remote stores are the same as those people paid by shoppers in the big cities. For forced divestiture to occur, the ACCC would need to recommend it to the Federal Court.The Federal Court would then need to weigh the evidence and conclude that divestiture was in the public interest and especially in the interests of shoppers at the stores that were to be sold. Shoppers in regional and remote Australia could only be disadvantaged by the forced divestiture legislation being pursued by the Nationals-Liberal-Green alliance on this. As a bipartisan policy of the Nationals and the Liberals, forced divestiture would harm voters in regional and remote Australia, but hey, it sounds tough, and it seems that\u2019s all that matters to them.

        "raw_text": "A 50-year extension to the North West Shelf (NWS) project in Western Australia would see huge amounts of gas given away with no return for Australians. While the exact volume and value is hard to predict, a basic estimate is that up to $215 billion worth of gas could be given away, royalty-free. The NWS liquefied natural gas facility, specifically the Karratha Gas Plant, producers up to 18.6 mega tonnes of LNG each year. At present, it sources around 75 per cent of its natural gas from the royalty-paying NWS gas fields off the coast of WA. These fields are the only major offshore gas project in WA that pays royalties, all others are royalty-free as the Commonwealth Government chooses not to charge a price for the public\u2019s gas. As we\u2019vepointed out before, the proponents of the NWS extension, Woodside, have not identified where all the gas will come from with major implications for WA gas prices. What is clear is that the royalty-paying NWS gas that feeds the Karratha Gas Plant is forecast to decline and it will increasingly be fed by gas from non-royalty paying reserves such as the Browse Basin, as shown in this chart that we first published here.  As shown in the above chart, it is possible that by 2036, none of the gas feeding the Karratha Gas Plant would be coming from royalty-paying reserves, although some gas could be sourced from Waitsia and other onshore or state-waters sources that would pay a royalty. Below, we conservatively assume that that 70 per cent of Karratha Gas Plant feedstock gas is royalty-free by the mid-2030s, and a price of $8 per gigajoule for gas, which is now common in WA wholesale trades. On these assumptions, the NWS shelf extension will be receiving around $5.1 billion a year in royalty-free gas, or $14 million each day, or $215 billion over the project\u2019s 46-year life. These calculations are shown in Table 1.  Across the 46-year extension of the project, a total $215 billion in free gas will be given away. For comparison, the output of the entire WA economy was $448 billion in 2024. Matt Saunders is a senior economist and Rod Campbell is research director at theAustralia Institute.",

        "raw_text": "A controversial gas project has been given the green light to keep operating for decades to come, provoking an angry response from environmental groups. New federal Environment Minister Murray Watt on Wednesday approved fossil fuel giant Woodside\u2019s proposal to extend its North West Shelf project in Western Australia. The approval, which allows Woodside to extend the project\u2019s life from 2030 to 2070, is subject to strict conditions about the impact of air emission levels from the expanded onshore gas plant at Karratha. The energy company has 10 business days to respond to the proposed decision. Watt said he would consider the response before a final decision was made. The impact of air emissions on the Murujuga rock art that forms part of the Dampier Archipelago was considered as part of the assessment process, he said. \u201cI have ensured that adequate protection for the rock art is central to my proposed decision,\u201d he said. Woodside\u2019s proposal to extend the operating life of the project has been under assessment for six years. The decision came after the release of a report indicating the United Nations will reject Australia\u2019s bid to add the Murujuga rock art to the World Heritage list. Its integrity was \u201cvulnerable due to industrial emissions, considered the majorly adversely affecting factor for the petroglyphs\u201d, the International Council on Monuments and Sites determined in its report to UNESCO. An agenda for UNESCO\u2019s meeting in July shows the draft decision will be deferred and the nomination sent back to the Australian government to address the risks to World Heritage values, including \u201cthe total removal of degrading acidic emissions currently impacting upon the petroglyphs\u201d. Australian Conservation Foundation climate campaigner Piper Rollins said the report \u201cclearly identified\u201d the North West Shelf gas hub as the primary risk to the ancient rock art. \u201cUNESCO is essentially saying to the Albanese government: you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it. You are going to have to choose between World Heritage or Woodside\u2019s toxic gas extension,\u201d she said. \u201cThe two cannot co-exist.\u201d Greenpeace Australia chief executive David Ritter said Watt\u2019s \u201cterrible decision\u201d brought Woodside\u2019s destructive gas drills one step closer to Scott Reef, a marine ecosystem that is home to threatened species such as pygmy blue whales and green sea turtles. \u201cThe North West Shelf facility is one of Australia\u2019s dirtiest and most polluting fossil fuel projects,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Albanese government\u2019s next decision on whether or not to approve Woodside\u2019s Browse proposal will show Australians the true colours of the government. We urge Minister Watt to stand up for nature and oceans and reject Woodside plans to drill at Scott Reef.\u201d Independent senator Lidia Thorpe said Watt\u2019s decision \u201ccould ignite a climate bomb\u201d and permanently destroy sacred sites, but he hadn\u2019t consulted traditional custodians and had ignored a heritage protection application lodged more than three years ago. \u201cThere is no way to justify this project \u2013 not when it will release billions of tonnes of emissions, not when we\u2019re watching Murujuga\u2019s sacred rock art being erased by pollution, and not when communities are suffering the impacts of climate collapse,\u201d Thorpe said. Watt flew to WA to meet stakeholders but refused to meet Murujuga custodians, she said. \u201cChoosing Reconciliation Week to push through this decision, while side-lining First Peoples, is not just disrespectful \u2013 it\u2019s disgraceful,\u201d she said. Watt, whose reputation as a dealmaker led to his shift into the environment portfolio, had promised to reach a decision on the extension by May 31. The federal government twice delayed a final decision until after the election, following approval from the WA government. Traditional owners have raised concerns about the impact of the expanded project on sacred rock art and launched legal action to try to compel Watt to protect the artwork. Research released by the Australia Institute showed that emissions from the planned extension would be equivalent to 33 years of Australia\u2019s entire emissions. -AAP",

        "raw_text": "Australia\u2019s inflation rate has held steady after a sharp rise in egg prices was somewhat offset by falling electricity costs. The monthly consumer price index remained at 2.4 per cent in the year ended April, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported on Wednesday. Economists had been expecting a 2.3 per cent rise. It\u2019s the third straight month that the index has held below the midpoint of the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s 2-3 per cent target range. But the central bank is unlikely to put too much stock in the headline figure, given it tends to bounce around from month to month. The bank\u2019s board places greater emphasis on less volatile quarterly inflation figures, which aren\u2019t due until the end of July, and in particular the quarterly trimmed mean, which also removes certain items from the CPI basket. The annual trimmed mean rose 2.8 per cent in April, up slightly from 2.7 in March. Price rises for food and non-alcoholic beverages slowed from 3.4 per cent to 3.1 per cent in April. They would have eased further if not for bird flu, said ABS head of prices statistics Michelle Marquardt. \u201cWhile annual inflation eased for most food categories in April, egg prices were up by 18.6 per cent in the past 12 months. This comes as supply has been affected by bird flu outbreaks,\u201d Marquardt said. Housing cost grew 0.4 percentage points faster in the 12 months to April, but new dwelling prices still rose at the slowest annual pace since April 2021 as project home builders offered discounts and promotional offers to entice business. Electricity prices fell 6.5 per cent, compared to a 9.6 per cent fall in the 12 months to March, as customers used up energy rebates in Queensland and Western Australia. The Reserve Bank predicts the trimmed mean to stay around the midpoint of its target range for the foreseeable future. RBA governor Michele Bullock retired the \u201cnarrow path\u201d analogy in her May 20 press conference following the board meeting, essentially acknowledging the battle against inflation was all but over. Her focus has turned to combating uncertainty caused by US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, with the RBA expecting the trade war to have a disinflationary impact on Australia. The board will have to wait for the second and third monthly readings of the quarter to get data on services inflation, which will show if low unemployment is flowing through to higher labour costs for businesses. \u201cOne area that the RBA had previously pointed to as a reason for not being confident that inflation can be sustained at current levels is the tightness of the labour market,\u201d said Westpac chief economist Luci Ellis. \u201cWhile it still highlighted indicators that suggested remaining tightness, the forecasts for unemployment have been lifted slightly, while those for employment and wages growth have been reduced slightly.\u201d -AAP",

        "raw_text": "As debate rages about the federal government\u2019s plan to lift the tax on earnings on superannuation balances over $3 million, it\u2019s worth revisiting why we offer super tax breaks in the first place, and why they need to be reformed. Tax breaks on super contributions mean less tax is paid on super savings than other forms of income. These tax breaks cost the federal budgetnearly $50 billion in lost revenue each year. These tax breaks boost the retirement savings of super fund members. They also ensure workers don\u2019t pay punitively high long-term tax rates on their super, since the impact of even low tax rates on savingscompounds over time. But theydisproportionately flow to older and wealthier Australians. Two-thirdsof the value of super tax breaks benefit the top 20 per cent of income-earners, who are already saving enough for their retirement. Few retirees draw down on their retirement savings as intended, and many are net savers \u2013 their super balancecontinues to grow for decadesafter they retire. By 2060, Treasury expects one-third of all withdrawals from super will be via bequests \u2013 up from one-fifth today. Superannuation in Australia was intended to help fund retirements. Instead, it has become a taxpayer-subsidised inheritance scheme. The tax breaks aren\u2019t just inequitable; they are economically unsound. Generous tax breaks for super savers mean other taxes (such as income and company taxes) must be higher to make up the forgone revenue. That means the burden falls disproportionately on younger taxpayers. The government\u2019s plan to increase the tax rate on superannuation earnings for balances exceeding $3 million from 15 per cent to 30 per cent is one modest step towards fixing these problems. The tax would only apply to the amountover$3 million, not the entire balance. This reform will affect only the top 0.5 per cent of super account holders \u2013 about80,000 people \u2013 and save more than $2 billion a yearin its first full year.  Claims that not indexing the $3 million thresholdwill result in the tax affecting most younger Australians, or that it will somehow disproportionately affect younger generations, are simply nonsense. Rather than being the biggest losers from the lack of indexation, younger Australians are the biggest beneficiaries. It means more older, wealthier Australians will shoulder some of the burden of budget repair and an ageing population. Otherwise, younger generations would bear this burden alone. The facts speak for themselves: a mere 0.5 per cent of Australians have more than $3 million in their super, and85 per cent of those are aged over 60. Even in the unlikely scenario where the threshold remains fixed until 2055 \u2013 or for 10 consecutive parliamentary terms \u2013 it would still only affectthe top 10 per centof retiring Australians. Treasurer Jim Chalmershas rightly pointed outthat it is unlikely the threshold will never be lifted. Far from abandoning the proposed $3 million threshold, the government should go further and drop the threshold to $2 million, and only then index it to inflation, saving the budget a further $1 billion a year. There is no rationale for offering such generous earnings tax breaks on super balances between $2 million and $3 million. At the very least, if the $3 million threshold is maintained, it should not be indexed until inflation naturally reduces its real value to $2 million,which is estimated to occur around 2040. Levying a higher tax rate on the earnings of large super balances is complicated by the fact existing super earnings taxes are levied at the fund level, not on individual member accounts. And it\u2019s true that levying a 15 per cent surcharge on the implied earnings of the account over the year (the change in account balance, net of contributions and withdrawals) will impose a tax on unrealised capital gains, or paper profits. Taxing capital gains as they build up removes incentives to \u201clock in\u201d investments to hold onto untaxed capital gains,as the Henry Tax Review recognised. But it can create cash flow problems for some self-managed super fund members who hold assets such as business premises or a farm in their fund. Yet there are seldom easy answers when it comes to tax changes. Most people with such substantial super balances are retirees who already maintain enough liquid assets to meet the minimum drawdown requirements. Indeed, self-managed super funds are legally obligated to have investment strategies that ensure liquidity and the ability to meet liabilities. In any case, the tax does not have to be paid from super. Australians with large super balances typically earn as much income from investments outside super. And the wealthiest 10 per cent of retirees todayrely more on income from outsidesuper than income from super. Australia faces thetwin challenges of big budget deficits and stagnant productivity. Tax reform will be needed to respond to both. Good public policy, like politics, always requires some level of compromise. Super tax breaks should exist only where they support a policy aim. And on balance, trimming unneeded super tax breaks for the wealthiest 0.5 per cent of Australians would make our super system fairer and our budget stronger.

        "raw_text": "Kmart has acknowledged the competition it faces from low-cost online retailers as it unveils a strategy to engage better with younger customers. Chinese sites like Temu and Shein, which offer fast fashion, are increasingly encroaching on Kmart\u2019s low-cost retail model \u2013 especially with Gen Z and younger Gen Alpha. Temu and Shein have joined Amazon and eBay as chief competitors to Kmart\u2019s market share. Kmart\u2019s new group managing director Aleks Spaseska has revealed the discount retailer\u2019s plan to double its turnover to $20 billion in the face of increasing competition from overseas outlets. Spaseska toldNine Newspapersthat Kmart plans tofurther develop its women\u2019s, men\u2019s and youth apparel ranges and beauty products, as well as ramping up electronics, toys and collectables. It will also deepen social media engagement as part of a broader goal to double its business in under 10 years. Expanding Kmart\u2019s popular low-cost home brand Anko is at the heart of the plan, alongside a major rethink of store layout and customer engagement. In an effort to maximise sales and promote brand loyalty with younger customers,Kmart has begun experimenting with layouts that bring clothing and beauty to the front of its outlets. \u201cThe biggest difference you\u2019ll notice is in the apparel and beauty offer in the store,\u201d Spaseska was quoted as saying. \u201cIf you go into women\u2019s apparel today, you\u2019ll see we mostly sell all the tops together, the bottoms together, the dresses together,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you walk the store in the new format, there\u2019s much more co-ordination through women\u2019s apparel, which allows customers to be much more inspired and helps with outfit building. \u201cWe\u2019ve also brought beauty to the front of the store as well.\u201d Kmart\u2019s Mount Gravatt store in Brisbane was the first to be refurbished in the new format late last year.Spaseska said the changes had already brought a sales bump. Kmart has earmarked four more stores for the layout redesign in the next month. If the changes continue to show positive results, every Kmart store will eventually be refurbished in the new style. The retailer will also focus on expanding its range of cleaning items, household accessories and appliances such as hair curlers. In the new layout, bigger items like bikes and car seats are moved off the shop floor room into storerooms for \u2018click and collect\u2019. That makes make more room for clothing and beauty products. Kmart is also opening a major new distribution centre in Sydney\u2019s west. Spaseska told News Corp she was confident discount retail chains could do well, even when better economic times return and consumers feel compelled to spend more on premium fashion, apparel, homewares and household goods. \u201cWhat we can see is that Kmart is really a brand for everyone. So we\u2019ve got very good levels of engagement across all customer demographics and across all levels, and they\u2019re spending with us, and we\u2019re seeing growth across all of those customer cohorts,\u201d she said. Wesfarmers-owned Kmart recorded in $11.1 billion in sales for the 2024 financial year with profits of almost $960 million.",

        "raw_text": "Let\u2019s face it \u2013 migration is a topic that sparks strong opinions. Some blame newcomers for high house prices and congested roads. Others say we need more migrants to keep the economy ticking over. Australia is grappling with a serious and persistent skills shortage that only migration can fix. Our universities rely heavily on the money international students bring. And yes, more people do mean more pressure on housing and infrastructure. But this isn\u2019t a simple \u201cmore migrants = bad\u201d equation. It\u2019s a tangled web of interconnected policies \u2013 migration, housing, infrastructure, and workforce \u2013 that at the moment too often get managed in isolation. That siloed approach has let our population grow faster than we can build homes or roads. We welcome more migrants to ease worker shortages and underwrite our university system, but we seemingly forget that they need homes, transport, and integration support. If we want a population policy that\u2019s sustainable \u2013 and fair \u2013 we need to plan smarter. That means acknowledging the ripple effects of big changes and putting guardrails in place to manage them. We all want affordable housing, sparkling infrastructure, fair wages, and well-integrated communities. But these goals can come under pressure if migration levels climb too quickly. That\u2019s why I believe Australia needs a national demographic strategy \u2013 a clear set of long-term targets to align housing, migration, and infrastructure policies. Even more challengingly, I want to establish a mechanism that forces government to integrate these sets of policies by creating national targets. We already accept the idea of targets when it comes to inflation. The Reserve Bank of Australia uses interest rates to keep inflation within a safe range. Sure, nobody enjoys high interest rates, but we accept them as the price of avoiding worse outcomes like runaway inflation. Why not apply a similar approach to housing, population, and infrastructure? Not by micromanaging every aspect of the economy, but by creating broad targets that trigger action when things drift too far off course. Let\u2019s start with housing. Instead of targeting fixed dollar values, we should aim to keep house prices within a sensibleincome-to-priceratio \u2013 say, four to six times the median income (today no capital city in Australia comes even close to that range). If prices rise above that range, it should trigger policy responses to cool the market. There are plenty of levers to pull \u2013 speeding up housing approvals, boosting public and built-to-rent housing developments, tackling demand-side distortions like negative gearing or foreign investment, or reforming stamp duty. Crucially, while the income-to-price ratio remains too high, we\u2019d hit pause on policies that are proven to drive up prices \u2013 like first-home buyer grants or letting people raid their super to buy a house. Once prices fall back within the target range, the interventions could be gradually rolled back. Yes, this would be a long-term project \u2013 think 20-plus years \u2013 and yes, it would be unpopular at first with home-owning voters. But just like we tolerate temporary pain from high interest rates to keep inflation in check, we might just learn to accept modest house price declines in exchange for long-term housing affordability. This target could also be backed by a commitment to grow public housing. Right now, public housing makes up just 4 per cent of homes. Aiming to lift that to 10 per cent would help clear waitlists and ease pressure in the broader market. Requiring a bigger slice of new housing to be set aside for social housing would slowly rebuild this crucial safety net. The second target should focus on Australia\u2019sdependency ratio\u2013 the balance between people of working age and those who aren\u2019t. As Baby Boomers age and demand for aged care ramps up, we\u2019ll need a much bigger workforce to support them. Setting a target range for the dependency ratio would let us fine-tune migration settings. We could aim for younger, permanent migrants to help slow the ageing of our population. Right now we have lots of people in their 30s, but fewer in their 20s. Migration can help smooth out those age gaps. This approach would also reflect the temporary nature of international student migration. Most students (five out of six) head home after graduation, so they do little to shift long-term demographic trends. A demographic strategy would help ensure our migration mix delivers what we need \u2013 we would work towards a desired population age profile. I\u2019m not calling for a command-and-control economy. What I\u2019m proposing is a common-sense strategy \u2013 a coordinated set of long-term goals that guide migration, housing, and infrastructure decisions. We already use this approach with monetary policy. The RBA doesn\u2019t run the whole economy, but it does use interest rates to keep inflation in check. Why not apply the same thinking to other parts of national policy? To work, this strategy should be managed by an independent, non-partisan group of public servants. These technocrats would match migration levels with workforce needs, housing supply, and infrastructure planning. That way, we could move beyond knee-jerk political responses and start making real, long-term progress. Getting bipartisan support won\u2019t be easy. But as our population ages and housing pressure builds, the need for a coordinated plan will only grow. Australia can either take control of its demographic destiny \u2013 or keep lurching from one crisis to the next. Simon Kuestenmacher is a co-founder of The Demographics Group.

        "raw_text": "Australia\u2019s short-term rental market is sizzling hot. \u2018\u2018Australia\u2019s short-term rental markets are absolutely exploding,\u2019\u2019 AirDNA chief economist Jamie Lane said. \u2018\u2018While other investors squabble over traditional long-term rentals with their predictable but uninspiring 3 per cent to 4 per cent yields, STR investors are quietly pocketing returns that would make stock market enthusiasts green with envy.\u2019\u2019 According to AirDNA\u2019s latest report on the most profitable Airbnb markets for 2025, the biggest earners for holiday investors aren\u2019t the usual urban suspects like Sydney or Melbourne. Instead, regional hotspots are stealing the show, thanks to strong domestic demand, low competition, and smart pricing strategies. Using annual revenue potential as the ranking metric, the study included any market with 100 or more listings for a comprehensive view of the STR market in Australia. Taking out the top spot in this year\u2019s rankings is the Whitsundays, boasting an impressive annual revenue potential of $141,372. While its average daily rate (ADR) of $602 is among the highest nationally, it\u2019s the RevPAR (revenue per available rental) of $414 \u2013 the top figure in Australia \u2013 that really seals the deal. \u2018\u2018This archipelago of 74 islands within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park attracts diverse tourists year-round. Airlie Beach serves as the gateway to attractions like world-famous Whitehaven Beach,\u2019\u2019 said Lane. A combination of aspirational appeal and consistent bookings has cemented its place as a premier short-term rental investment. While high ADR might seem like a clear path to big profits, the data tells a more nuanced story. Take Singleton in the Hunter Valley, for instance, which reports a staggering ADR of $862 \u2013 the highest in the country \u2013 but ranks second overall in profitability with $116,033 in potential revenue. Similarly, Cessnock, also in the Hunter, has the third-highest ADR of $676, but comes in fourth place on the list generating nearly $96,621 annually. These are still excellent returns, but ultra-high pricing means properties must maintain top-tier appeal and service to justify the cost. It\u2019s also true that the higher the nightly rate, the smaller your potential renter pool and therefore yearly occupancy \u2013 and consistent occupancy can have greater impact than peak pricing when it comes to overall returns. \u2018\u2018While ADR might seem like the star of the show, it\u2019s actually more of a supporting character. Yes, charging $500/night sounds impressive, but if your property sits vacant half the year, you\u2019re leaving money on the table,\u2019\u2019 said Lane. \u2018\u2018The real magic happens at the intersection of price and demand \u2013 finding that sweet spot where your calendar stays full without unnecessarily discounting your property\u2019s value.\u2019\u2019 Exmouth in Western Australia claims the third spot, with revenue potential of $101,976 \u2013 a figure driven by strong seasonal demand and limited rental supply. This dynamic allows owners to command high rates during peak periods while avoiding oversaturation. \u2018\u2018This remote coastal town serves as the gateway to Ningaloo Reef, one of the world\u2019s largest fringing reefs and a UNESCO World Heritage site. Exmouth\u2019s primary appeal comes from seasonal attractions like whale shark swimming (March-July) and humpback whale watching (August-October),\u2019\u2019 said Lane. \u2018\u2018The destination\u2019s limited accommodation supply and strong demand contribute to its solid RevPAR performance.\u2019\u2019 Meanwhile, Byron Bay, a consistent Airbnb performer, rounds out the top five with $95,004 in annual earnings. Despite the STR market here being heavily saturated, what keeps Byron competitive is its strong domestic appeal, high pricing power and a steady flow of visitors year-round. \u2018\u2018Iconic Byron Bay ranks fifth with $95K annual revenue potential and Australia\u2019s third-highest RevPAR at $324,\u2019\u2019 said Lane. \u2018\u2018Byron\u2019s appeal stems from its stunning beaches, laid-back atmosphere, thriving food scene, and retreats and spas.\u2019\u2019 A key trend across all the top markets is the role of domestic travellers. With many Australians continuing to explore regional destinations post-pandemic, coastal towns and wine regions are enjoying sustained occupancy. International travellers \u2013 led by New Zealand, the US, and the UK \u2013 are returning, but it\u2019s the local market that\u2019s keeping these regional destinations profitable. For those eyeing a slice of the short-term rental market, the message is clear: A high nightly rate doesn\u2019t always equal the best investment. Instead, look to regions with steady demand, low competition, and strong RevPAR. From the beaches of Queensland to the vineyards of the Hunter, regional Australia continues to offer some of the country\u2019s most compelling investment opportunities.

        "raw_text": "Insurance within super \u2013 at what stage should you discontinue it? As you get towards retirement age, premiums get dearer and your fund balance increases to the extent that a death benefit is not needed. This can be a tricky question and there is no black and white answer. Insurance within super provides you with at least some cover should you die or become totally or temporarily disabled. You make some good points though. Premiums do get a lot more expensive when you are older. Especially from the mid-50s onwards. This is, of course, due to the fact you are far more likely to make a claim as you get older. Depending on your fund and the type of cover, most super funds stop your policy between mid-60s and age 70. You should make a conscious decision about whether you want to keep your policy, and if yes, the amount of cover. Some things to consider when making your decision: It\u2019s a trade-off between being fully covered versus building your super to have a nice retirement. The answer may not be all or nothing, you could decide to just dial back some of your cover. Many super funds can provide you with personal advice about the insurance that you hold with them. The advice is often covered by your membership fee and no additional fee would be payable. You should consider speaking with your fund about this. I\u2019m62 years old with a part-time job earning around $25,000 a year. I get a supplementfrom Jobseeker and have a pensioner card. I\u2019m looking to downsize soon and with some of the extra funds I would like to pay off both my daughters\u2019 HECS fees. This would be around $40,000-$45,000. Is there a way of doing this that won\u2019t penalise any of us tax-wise or my Jobseeker payment? Or would it be better to just stick to gifting them a smaller amount over a few years? There is no negative tax consequence in what you are proposing. However, Centrelink would consider this gifting and it would be caught under their deprivation rules. Deprivation arises where a person disposes (gifts), destroys or diminishes the value of an asset or income without receiving adequate financial consideration. Under social security legislation, amounts exceeding the \u2018disposal-free areas\u2019 are treated as a deprived asset. They are then assessed for five years from the date of the relevant disposal. The disposal free areas are $10,000 in a financial year or $30,000 over any rolling five financial-year period. Anything above that is still considered an asset that is owned by yourself for five years. Therefore, you can pay off $45,000 in your daughters\u2019 HECS debt. You would not see any reduction in your benefits, but $35,000 would still be considered an asset owned by yourself for the next five years. You may even receive a small increase in payments from Centrelink because you have $10,000 less. The main takeout is don\u2019t leave yourself short. You will no longer have access to these funds and would only receive a minimal increase in support payments. When you make a downsizer contribution into a super account, i-s it classed as non-concessional and forms part of the tax-free component? If so, upon death, do my non-dependent children claim my super tax-free? \u2018Down-sizer super\u2019 contributions do not count under the concessional (pre-tax) or non-concessional (post-tax) caps. They have their own category and cap, which is $300,000. If you have a spouse, then each partner can make up to $300,000 in down-sizer contributions from the sale of one residence. These contributions go into the \u2018tax-free\u2019 component of your super. Therefore, no tax would be payable when paid out as a death benefit, regardless of who it is paid to.

It\u2019s not addressing the housing affordability crisis, which has shown that rental stress is at record highs, social housing doesn\u2019t come close to meeting demand, and safe and affordable housing is becoming a luxury. It\u2019s not raising the rate or ending mutual obligations or ensuring that we actually do lift people out of poverty, a test we carried out during the pandemic and proved we can achieve quite simply, if there is the will. And it\u2019s not only climate, which is about to get another kick in the guts domestically with Labor to approve the 50-year expansion of Woodside\u2019s North West Shelf project \u2013 which will add the equivalent of a dozen coal-fired power stations of emissions to the atmosphere, increase domestic costs for Western Australians and further erode priceless rock art that survived an ice age. It\u2019s not even Australia\u2019s continued absenteeism in responding to Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza. No, it\u2019s none of those. It\u2019s even bigger. Are you ready? It\u2019s \u2026 very rich people being asked to pay a tiny bit of tax on a small percentage of the earnings on their wealth. Yup. Labor\u2019s very modest super changes. Which it announced in the last term of parliament but said it wouldn\u2019t move on until this term, to give the 80,000 or so people this will impact time to get used to paying a tiny bit of extra tax. (Or receiving a lower tax break, depending on how you look at things.) It\u2019s a whopping 0.5 per cent of the population we are talking about here. According to the tax office, the average income of someone with $3 million in their super is $381,000. If you have more than $5 million in superannuation, your average income is about $495,000. And if you are one of the handful with more than $20 million in your super, your average income is just short of $1.3 million. We\u2019re not exactly talking Jan and Joe Average here. Oh, but maybe one day you COULD have $3 million in your super and then you too will be subjected to having to pay a tiny bit of tax on earnings above that $3 million balance. Not the balance itself \u2013 just the earnings on the capital above $3 million. Let\u2019s say that COULD be you, or your children. And yes, sure, one day in 20 or 30 years, it COULD impact more people. Think you might one day have $3m in your super & be affected by the super tax changes? Ok, you are 18yo, you just got a job \u2013 it pays\u2026 $150k!Give yourself a 3.7% annual pay rise.Never take time off for study, kids or illness.

Unlike most 18 year olds, Prudence is very worried about her superannuation balance and has spent a lot of time reading Tim Wilson\u2019s socials, so Prudence is heading into the labour market ready to do battle. For Prudence to retire with $3 million, she has to earn at least $150,000 a year right off the bat. Then she needs to secure at least a 3.7 per cent annual pay rise. And no time off, Prudence! No unpaid leave time for you! If she does all of that, she will retire with just over $3 million in her super account. Thoughts and prayers for Prudence then (assuming that the same legislation has remained in place and untouched for her entire working life), for she will receive a slightly lower tax break (or a slightly higher tax applied, again depending on how you look at it) on the earnings above her $3 million balance. That\u2019s a huge amount to take in. Better not do anything then, because poor Prudence! Hilariously, the AFR is showing just how absurd is the scare campaign against the super tax changes. They give an eg where someone\u2019s super goes from $2m to $3.18m in a year! Yep a $1.18m increase. How much extra tax? $1,528! OMG!!

It\u2019s not going to impact investment, or the start-up sector, or even farmers (someone would have put their farm into their superannuation only to pay less tax. It is not the responsibility of the Australian people to keep subsidising wealthy people\u2019s assets). What it is going to do, is tax the rich. Just a tiny, tiny, tiny bit more.It\u2019s a slightly lower tax concession for people who have more money than you could ever need to retire, who want to maintain their tax breaks. We know that self-managed super funds are popular as tax avoidance mechanisms and estate planning vehicles. These very small changes are just addressing some of the vast imbalances in wealth in this country, where rich people can move assets and wealth into whatever provides them with the best tax break, abusing systems built to ensure a fair retirement, not non-stop wealth accumulation. And the rich people are very annoyed at being asked to pay a tiny bit more tax than they planned to. Finance professor Mark Humphery-Jenner told theAustralian Financial Reviewthat it was \u201cmoral repugnance [to target] someone merely because they are wealthy\u201d. But the fact is, it is morally repugnant to NOT tax the rich. Especially now. A recent ANU study found that the pre-tax income of Australians aged over 60 was equal to the average mid-career income of 65 per cent of the working population (and much higher than most workers aged between 18 and 30). That\u2019s been fuelled by government policy in the past couple of decades, which has led to older generations earning significantly more private income \u201cprimarily as a result of higher capital income from real estate and superannuation\u201d. Put simply, previous generations have enjoyed tax breaks and policies that have helped them amass wealth younger generations can only dream of. And now people are complaining they might receive a slightly lower tax concession on part of that wealth. Apparently we all need to be very worried about budget deficits and the need for structural reform \u2013 but only if modestly addressing it doesn\u2019t make rich people upset. It\u2019s very telling that the critics of this modest policy have used farmers as the poster group for who might be harmed. That\u2019s because they know if they showed you someone in Double Bay or Cottesloe (where the median incomes are $428,489 and $365,588) no one would care. And rightly so. The legislation will be Labor\u2019s first big test in the new parliament. Not because it\u2019s bad policy, but because it upsets people who are not used to being the target of government cuts. Perhaps they could go chat to someone on JobSeeker or the minimum wage for tips to adjust their budgets.",

However, this is false as the changes only apply to superannuation accounts with balances of more than $3 million. The Albanese governmentintroduced laws in 2023that changed the concessional arrangements on superannuation earnings for accounts valued over $3 million. Currently, earnings on superannuation accounts in the accumulation phase, when money is being contributed prior to retirement, are taxed at a concessional rate of up to 15 per cent. Under the proposed changes(p3), super accounts will be subject to an additional 15 per cent tax on a proportion of earnings corresponding to the share of the super balance exceeding $3 million. The reforms remain before the Senate, but are expected to pass with the support of the Greens when parliament resumes from July 22. The government has previously estimatedthat about 0.5 per cent of superannuation accounts \u2013 about 80,000 \u2013 will be subject to the changes. Commentators have raised concerns that the policy could open the door to wider \u201cwealth taxes\u201d, but in its current form, it does not apply to all unrealised gains. A Treasury spokesperson pointed AAP FactCheckto the 2023 policy announcement. \u201cMore than 99.5 per cent of Australians will continue to receive the same generous tax breaks that help them save more for retirement through superannuation,\u201d the release said. \u201cThe 0.5 per cent of individuals with superannuation accounts over $3 million will receive less generous tax breaks for balances that are beyond what is necessary to fund a comfortable retirement.\u201d AAP FactCheck is an accredited member of the International Fact-Checking Network.

        "raw_text": "In a bold move not seen since the height of Covid-19, the Reserve Bank of Australia has delivered two rate cuts in three meetings, bringing the official cash rate down to 3.85 per cent. The decision, anticipated by 88 per cent of experts inFinder\u2019s RBA Cash Rate Survey, aims to ease mortgage stress and stimulate broader economic activity. \u201cFrankly, two cuts might not be enough to ease the spike in mortgage stress we\u2019ve seen since rates started climbing again in May 2022,\u201d Finder head of consumer research Graham Cooke said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a step in the right direction and great news for home owners. It\u2019s two down and maybe two more to go this year.\u201d If those additional cuts materialise, borrowers could save up to $5,044 a year, assuming lenders pass on the reductions in full. Cooke also noted the value of proactively shopping around: \u201cThere\u2019s a 40-point difference between the average and lowest rates available. You could effectively give yourself two rate cuts by refinancing.\u201d Chris Bates, CEO ofAlcove Mortgage Brokers, said borrowers should take action now. \u201cThere\u2019s a refinance war brewing behind the scenes, with banks offering amazing pricing when you\u2019re looking to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to reach out to your lender or a broker, they\u2019re aggressively competing to retain customers.\u201d Changes to HECS, including a 25 per cent debt reduction and exclusion from mortgage assessments, combined with increased borrowing capacity (up around 2.5 per cent) are creating new opportunities for first-home buyers.  However, any newfound power may be offset by rapidly rising property prices. \u201cThere\u2019s increased interest across the board since the first cut and the more that happens, the more it will build,\u201d Bates said. \u201cHowever, upgraders are still very hesitant to take action under higher rates. If there are significant cuts with confidence that they will stay low, upgraders will come back strongly, as many families are not in the right property to suit their situation long term, and it makes sense to upgrade your home to a better tax-free growth asset.\u201d \u201cBuyers are still out and about, which is reflected in auction clearance rates consistently holding above 60 per cent,\u201dLJ Hookerresearch head Mathew Tiller said. \u201cThe decision by the RBA to reduce rates won\u2019t shoot the lights out in the market by any means, as there are still affordability pressures due to recent price growth. But we anticipate seeing demand pick up as confidence returns. With more cuts expected, buyers will be looking to get in before rates fall further and demand strengthens.\u201d Yet broader economic risks are still in play, including international headwinds. \u201cThe big unknown remains how Trump\u2019s tariffs will impact Australia\u2019s inflation rate,\u201d saidNerida Conisbee, chief economist at Ray White. \u201cSupply chain disruptions and global pricing shifts could increase costs, though this might be offset by cheaper Chinese exports as they seek new markets. The RBA will be watching this closely.\u201d Conisbee said that while Australia\u2019s property market had historically weathered global shocks (such as the global financial crisis and Covid-19) a repeat of the 2021 boom was unlikely. \u201cThe market is strengthening, but we\u2019re in a very different financial environment. During Covid, the cash rate hit 0.1 per cent and households were flush with savings. Today, the cost of living remains high, savings are lower, and rates won\u2019t fall anywhere near those pandemic-era lows.\u201d She said that while price growth should continue, it would likely be more moderate and sustainable.

        "raw_text": "The Reserve Bank of Australiacut the official interest ratefor the second time this year, as it lowered forecasts for Australian economic growth and pointed to increasing uncertainty in the world economy. The bank lowered thecash rate targetby 0.25 per cent, from 4.1 per cent to 3.85 per cent, saying inflation is expected to remain in the target band. All the big four banks swiftly passed the cut on to households with mortgages. This will save a household with a $500,000 loan about $80 a month. Announcing the cut, the Reserve Bankstressedin its accompanying statement it stands ready to reduce rates again if the economic outlook deteriorates sharply. The board considered a severe downside scenario and noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond decisively to international developments if they were to have material implications for activity and inflation in Australia. The latestConsumer Price Indexshowed that inflation remained around the middle of the Reserve Bank\u2019smedium-term target band of 2-3 per centin the March quarter. The Reserve Bank was also comforted by the underlying inflation measure called the \u201ctrimmed mean\u201d. This measure excludes items with the largest price movements up or down. The bank noted that it has returned to the 2-3 per cent target band for the first time since 2021. This suggests inflation is not just temporarily low due to temporary factors such as the electricity price rebates.  In February, RBA governor Michele Bullockconcededthe bank had arguably been \u201clate raising interest rates on the way up\u201d. It did not want to be late on the way down. Perhaps Bullock is being unduly modest. The central bank looks to have judged well the extent of monetary tightening. It did not raise interest rates as much as its peers, but still got inflation back to the target.  Last week, we got anupdateon the strength of the labour market. Unemployment stayed at 4.1 per cent. It has now been around 4 per cent since late 2023, a remarkable achievement. This is below the 4.5 per cent the Reserve Bank hadregardedas the level consistent with steady inflation (in economic jargon, theNAIRU). But neither prices norwageshave accelerated.  In its updatedforecasts, the bank sees headline inflation dropping to 2.1 per cent by mid-year but going back to 3.0 per cent by the end of the year, as the electricity subsidies are removed. By mid-2027, it will be back near the middle of the 2-3 per cent target. Underlying inflation is forecast to stay around the middle of the target band throughout. The Reserve Bank cut its forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) to 2.1 per cent by December, down from its previous forecast of 2.4 per cent made in February. It said: Economic policy uncertainty has increased sharply alongside recent global developments, and this is expected to prompt some households to increase their precautionary savings and some businesses to postpone some investment decisions. The unemployment rate is expected to increase to 4.3 per cent by the end of the year and remain there through 2026. Cost-of-living pressures look set to ease, as real household disposable income grows faster than population. As the Reserve Bank governor told a media conference on Tuesday: There\u2019s now a new set of challenges facing the economy, but with inflation declining and the unemployment rate relatively low, we\u2019re well positioned to deal with them. The board remains prepared to take further action if that is required. The main uncertainty in the global economy is how the trade war instigated by US President Donald Trump will play out.According to one count, he has announced new or revised tariff policies about 50 times. \u201cThe outlook for the global economy has deteriorated since the February statement. This is due to the adverse impact on global growth from higher tariffs and widespread economic and policy unpredictability,\u201d the bank noted. The US tariff pauses on the highest rates on China and most other nations are due to be in place for 90 days. But more measures may be announced before then. This uncertainty is likely to be stifling trade, and even more so investment decisions by companies in the face of rapidly changing policies. And it will weaken the global economy. In herpress conference, Bullock said the board\u2019s judgment was that \u201cglobal trade developments will overall be disinflationary for Australia\u201d. Not only is the global outlook weaker, but some goods no longer being sold to the US could be diverted to Australia. The Reserve Bank\u2019s updatedforecastsassume interest rates will fall further, to 3.4 per cent by the end of the year. But this is just a reflection of whatfinancial markets are implying. It is not necessarily what the bank itselfexpectsto do. It is certainty not apromiseof what they will do. But the Reserve Bank still regards its stance as \u201crestrictive\u201d, or weighing on growth. So if it continues to believe inflation will stay within the target band, or the global outlook deteriorates, it will cut rates further.

        "raw_text": "Australia\u2019s big four banks have been quick to confirm they will pass on Tuesday\u2019s official interest rate cut to borrowers. The banks took less than an hour after theReserve Bank confirmed it had cut rates by a quarter of a percentage pointto announce they would reduce their own variable rates. The widely anticipated decision, as the RBA flagged concerns about global economic uncertainty, follows a first 25 basis point-cut in February. It brings the official cash rate down to 3.85 per cent. It\u2019s the first time the key interest rate has had a three in front of it in two years. \u201cToday\u2019s decision will help to deliver some much-needed additional relief for many Australians with a mortgage,\u201d said Angus Sullivan, group executive retail banking services at the Commonwealth Bank, Australia\u2019s largest home lender. \u201cWhen combined with the February rate cut, this change should free up some more cash flow for homeowners who need it. We know many have had tighter budgets in recent months and will welcome that additional flexibility.\u201d Borrowers with a median mortgage of $600,000 can expect to pay about $90 less a month in interest repayments. The CBA said its customers on average $500,000 loans would save $80 a month. Treasurer Jim Chalmers said it was very welcome relief for millions of Australians. \u201cWhen it comes to inflation, both headline and underlying inflation are now both in the Reserve Bank\u2019s target band for the first time in almost four years,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first time since records began that we\u2019ve got the unemployment rate in the low fours at the same time as we\u2019ve got both measures of inflation in the target band at the same time. \u201cWe know that the job is not finished we know that there\u2019s more work to do, but this is a very good development and we welcome it.\u201d In her post-meeting statement, RBA governor Michele Bullock said the central bank board acknowledged it had been a tough time for many Australians. \u201cBut it was essential we brought inflation down because inflation hurts everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cThe strategy that we took to achieve this was different to that of some other central banks, who took rates much higher than we did. The board accepted the trade off that, leaving the cash rate where it was would bring inflation down more gradually, but without a big increase in unemployment \u2013 a sharp rise in unemployment would have been very costly for families and for the Australian economy.\u201d Money markets and most economists had tipped the cut ahead of the RBA board\u2019s announcement, citing moderating inflation, sluggish consumer spending and a dour economic growth outlook fuelled by trade uncertainty. The consumer price index for the March quarter remained steady at 2.4 per cent, while trimmed mean inflation, which removes volatile price movements, dropped to 2.9 per cent. Both measures are within the Reserve Bank\u2019s target band of 2-3 per cent. But stronger-than-expected unemployment and wages growth, as well as a pause in trade hostilities between the US and China, reduced the urgency for the RBA to remove monetary restrictiveness. \u201cSince our last meeting [in April], global economic and policy uncertainty has increased substantially following tariff announcements by the US administration,\u201d Bullock said. \u201cThe response of its trading partners and subsequent changes to the policies, including various bilateral agreements and deals \u2013 it\u2019s been a complete roller-coaster.\u201d The board judged that the global trade turmoil would be disinflationary in Australia. \u201cHowever, there is a risk to inflation on the other side; the trade policies could lead to supply chain issues, which could raiseprices for some imports, much as we saw during the pandemic,\u201d Bullock said. \u201cWe\u2019ll also need to be alert to such upside risks.\u201d In its quarterly update to its economic forecasts, the RBA lowered its prediction for underlying inflation from 2.7 per cent to 2.6 per cent by the middle of the year, as a result of Donald Trump\u2019s trade war. Australia\u2019s economy is tipped to grow 0.3 percentage points slower in 2025 at 2.1 per cent, while inflation is expected to peak 0.1 percentage higher at 4.3 per cent. -with AAP",

        "raw_text": "Households struggling with hefty mortgage payments have scored another win with the Reserve Bank announcing a further cut to official interest rates. The central bank\u2019s 25 basis point-cut in the official cash rate to 3.85 per cent, announced on Tuesday afternoon, had been widely predicted by economists. The announcement, which came at the end of the bank board\u2019s two-day meeting, is only the second cut to mortgage interest rates in Australia in almost five years. Assuming banks pass the latest cut on in full, it will mean the median mortgage-holder with a $600,000 debt will pay about $90 less a month in interest. It follows February\u2019s landmark first cut and the decisionat the RBA\u2019s pre-election meeting in early April for another pause. It takes rates to their lowest level since May 2023. In its statement after the decision was released, the RBA board noted inflation had fallen \u201csubstantially\u201d since its peak in 2022. \u201cData on inflation for the March quarter provided further evidence that inflation continues to ease,\u201d it said. However, it also noted that global uncertainty had spiked in the past three months and there was still \u201cconsiderable uncertainty\u201d around tariffs \u2013 such as those imposed by US President Donald Trump. \u201cThe board assesses that this move will make monetary policy somewhat less restrictive. It nevertheless remains cautious about the outlook, particularly given the heightened level of uncertainty about both aggregate demand and supply,\u201d it said. Earlier, Finance Minister Katy Gallagher said homeowners would have been keenly awaiting the latest interest rate ruling,\u00a0 adding that a fall in inflation levels was a positive sign. \u201cWe know inflation has come back into band \u2026 and that is a welcome progress that has been made over the last two years,\u201d she told ABC TV on Tuesday. \u201cWe know that has been hard for households.\u201d Inflation for the March quarter remained steady at 2.4 per cent, while underlying inflation, which removes volatile price movements, dropped to 2.9 per cent. Both measures are within the Reserve Bank\u2019s target band of 2-3 per cent. Nicola Powell, chief economist at property portal Domain, said Tuesday\u2019s interest rate cut was pretty much a given. As well as moderating inflation and sluggish consumer spending, US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs have bolstered the case for a cut to support the Australian economy, amid an anticipated global slowdown. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s going to be at the forefront of their mind, the impact that that is going to have on the domestic economy,\u201d Powell said. Gallagher said that prices remained high, despite progress on inflation. \u201cSome of those really high peaks in inflation really hit household budgets, and people felt it when they went to the supermarket, when they paid their bills,\u201d she said. \u201cWe get the job isn\u2019t done either and that we\u2019ve got to continue our focus, not only on inflation but also on productivity on that side of the economy over the next couple of years.\u201d Given the widespread expectations of a rate cut have now been met, market attention has quickly turned to the Reserve Bank\u2019s statement and governor Michele Bullock for signs of where the board is likely to go next. How much Bullock pushes back on market pricing of the cash rate, as she did following the February decision, will feed into investor confidence of further cuts. She is due to address the media later on Tuesday. -with AAP",

        "raw_text": "We humans understand the world best in comparison. A single number means little unless we can anchor it to something familiar. That\u2019s why in my columns you always see me benchmark data across time, place, people, and purpose. Without these anchors, stats are just stray numbers drifting in space. In my writing and on stage as a public speaker I learned that Australiansloveknowing how we compare to other countries. When international benchmarking enters the chat, the usual suspects are the US, UK, Canada, and New Zealand. We speak the same language (more or less), share colonial histories, and have a cultural closeness that makes comparisons feel natural. But if we only ever look at our cousins, we miss bigger, bolder lessons. Australia often looks to the US as both an inspiration and a cautionary tale. As the global economic and cultural superpower, the US sets most of the trends that shape Australian media, tech, and policy debates. From healthcare models to university fees to homeownership rates, comparisons with the US help Australians understand where we align with or diverge from a more individualistic, market-driven society. The UK is Australia\u2019s historical reference point \u2013 our legal system, parliamentary democracy and even many place names trace back to Britain. Social norms, class structures, and policy legacies often mirror British roots. When Australians debate housing affordability, education models, or public broadcasting, it\u2019s natural to look at how the \u201cmother country\u201d is managing similar challenges. Canada is Australia\u2019s policy twin in many ways. We\u2019re both vast, resource-rich, sparsely populated countries with multicultural cities and strong historical ties to the British Crown. Canada gives us a glimpse of how similar nations tackle immigration, healthcare, and climate policy \u2013 often in ways that feel more European in tone. Comparing ourselves to Canada feels like comparing two parallel experiments in liberal democracy (albeit one experiment has much better beaches). New Zealand is Australia\u2019s sibling in both geography and culture. We share close economic ties, a trans-Tasman labour market, and similar education and health systems. When one country tweaks a policy, the other watches closely. Whether it\u2019s housing reform, Indigenous reconciliation, or pandemic management, the Kiwi benchmark is impossible to ignore. Whenever I write a column, it\u2019s these four benchmark nations that I am immediately drawn to \u2013 for good reason I would say. After a while, using the same four benchmarks becomes a bit boring. I want a to spice up my life. I want new benchmarks! Let\u2019s widen the lens. Let\u2019s find some new countries weshouldcompare Australia to more often. It might seem like an odd match at first, but Brazil and Australia are more alike than you\u2019d think. Both are vast countries with largely uninhabitable interiors (rainforest in Brazil\u2019s case, Outback desert in ours). We\u2019re both resource powerhouses, relying heavily on agricultural and mining exports. We worship sport (Brazil has football; we have\u2026 everything), and we\u2019re beach-obsessed coastal dwellers with sunny climates and laid-back vibes. When looking at emerging markets, Brazil is a useful mirror. It can be a useful cautionary tale when telling stories about Australia\u2019s declining middle class, the lack of social cohesion, and worsening inequality. We can also look up to Brazil as the nation manages a more complex economy than Australia. Brazil diversified its industrial base, producing and exporting more complex goods like automobiles, aircraft (Embraer), machinery, and pharmaceuticals. Here is a simple lesson for Australia: Don\u2019t just dig and ship. Build and export too. Complexity creates resilience. For Australia to increase its industrial output at least a little bit, energy costs would of course need to fall dramatically. In certain Australian policy circles, Sweden is omnipresent.We often invoke it when discussing welfare models, parental leave, or housing cooperatives. But unlike Australia, Sweden is compact, cold and cohesive in ways we\u2019re not. Comparing ourselves to Sweden reveals our deeper policy choices: we tax less, spend less on social services, and build fewer apartments. Sweden however is a constant reminder that different choices are possible. The mere existence of Sweden (even if we created some sort of fantasy version of Sweden in our heads) is useful to writers like me as we can make readers see that a radically different approach is possible. Granted, in recent years it became less popular to draw on Israel as a comparison. Extremely unique in its history and geopolitical role, there truly is no country similar to Israel. The nation remains a great case study for what can happen when you heavily invest in innovation, tech, and research and development. For all our talk of \u201cvalue-added exports\u201d and moving beyond dig-and-ship economics, Israel shows what it takes \u2013 a long-term investment in education, risk-taking startups and a healthy dose of national ambition. Benchmarking against Israel challenges Australia to think bigger and reminds us that footloose industries really can be setup anywhere in the world. Australia has great lifestyle, wonderful beaches, and a great international reputation to attract tech workers and emerging businesses from the US and other high-tech centres. If we (rather miraculously) were to offer affordable housing and less stringent regulatory frameworks for startups, I truly believe a sizeable tech sector could be established in Australia. The little city-state that could. Singapore gets name-dropped in every conversation about smart infrastructure, public housing, intergenerational living and urban planning. In many ways it\u2019s not a fair comparison as Singapore is tiny, tightly controlled and operates under a niche political setup. However, comparing ourselves to Singapore exposes our planning inefficiencies. Where we sprawl, they stack. Where we debate endlessly, they execute. Where we think short-term, they think long-term. Singapore is a benchmark in doing things at scale and speed. Sometimes a country is a very useful benchmark for no other reason than the writer having detailed local knowledge. I was born, raised and educated in Germany. My birth nation is a valuable benchmark for Australia when it comes to advanced manufacturing and vocational education. Any discussion about advancing Australia\u2019s manufacturing sector is shot down by pointing to our high wages. Germany shows what a high-wage country can achieve by investing in engineering, apprenticeships and value-added production. Germany proves that it\u2019s at least possible to maintain global competitiveness without racing to the bottom on wages. For Australia, benchmarking against Germany highlights that our \u201cdig and ship\u201d approach could be complemented by an emerging \u201cdesign and build\u201d approach. Next time you see a statistic about Australia, ask yourself: Compared to when? Compared to where? Compared to whom? That\u2019s how we turn numbers into narratives, and that\u2019s how we make sense of the world.Benchmarked data turns into a story. Without a benchmark, it remains but a fact without context.

        "raw_text": "The age Australians can access their superannuation savings will not start increasing to 70 from 2025, despite claims that are winding up social media users. The Australian Taxation Office says the age at which retirement savings in super can be accessed is set at 60 and will not change from June 1, 2025. The claim is being repeated inFacebook postsfrom outraged social media users saying the recently re-elected Labor government plans to increase the superannuation preservation age by 10 years by 2030. \u201cWho the F\u2014 do these governments think they are raising the preservation age on superannuation,\u201d one post reads. \u201cAt no time did I get asked or anyone get consulted. They just pass these things and nobody is told.\u201d Another post says: \u201cYour super being pushed further out of reach of retires from June this year. They want you to work until you die.\u201d The posts include screenshots from a suspicious website, claiming that after June 1, 2025, the age will gradually increase to 70 by 2030. The ATO, which manages key elements of the superannuation system, said in a statement that the claims originated from \u201ca proliferation of dodgy websites sharing fake news\u201d. Australia\u2019s preservation age \u2013 the earliest age at which people can access their superannuation, barring exceptional circumstances \u2013 is set at 60. People born between July 1, 1960, and June 30, 1964, have differing preservation ages under changes announced in the 1990s that were progressively phased in. But by July 1, 2024, everyone born during that period had turned 60, meaning Australia\u2019s preservation age is effectively 60 for all. ATO deputy commissioner Emma Rosenzweig said claims that the age would change from June 2025 were unfounded. \u201cThis is classic fake news,\u201d she said in a statement to AAP FactCheck. Rosenzweig urged people to consider the source of information they see about changes to superannuation. If in doubt, they should check trusted sources such as the ATO website or their super fund website, registered tax agent or licensed financial adviser. \u201cThink twice before acting on information heard from third-party sources, including non-official websites or on social media,\u201d she said. One change to super that will kick in from July 1, 2025, relates to the super guarantee \u2013 the percentage of a worker\u2019s wage employers are required to pay into superannuation accounts From then, the super guarantee will rise from 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent, the ATO website said.
