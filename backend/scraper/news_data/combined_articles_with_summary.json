        "raw_text": "Tasmania's AFL licence hangs by the barest of threads, following a day of mass upheaval in the state parliament. A no-confidence motion against Premier Jeremy Rockliff, moved by the Labor opposition and supported by a majority of the house, was being debated into Wednesday evening. A no-confidence motion in Tasmanian premier Jeremy Rockliff appears set to succeed. Follow the coverage live. The outcome is likely to result in the ousting of Mr Rockliff as premier, potentially sending Tasmanians back to the polls, a little over a year since the last election. That potential election throws the Macquarie Point stadium, and plans for the Tasmanian Devils, into chaos. At a press conference this morning, Devils general manager of marketing, corporate affairs and social impact, Kath McCann, broke down in tears when discussing the possibility of the team falling over before formally starting. \"The goings on of the last 24 hours are really serious for the club. This is an unprecedented level of uncertainty for the club,\" she said. Both houses of Tasmania's parliament were due to vote on special enabling legislation designed to grant planning approval for the stadium, within the next six weeks. But an early election could see that opportunity to vote disappear, leading to what the club would consider an irreparable blowout in construction and team establishment timelines. Jeremy Rockliff has faced criticism over his handling of the stadium project.(ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke) The Devils have accepted that outcome would likely void the government's deal with the AFL, that stipulates the Macquarie Point stadium be built by early 2029. \"It'd be fair to say that the level of uncertainty would be significantly heightened,\" McCann said. There has been no appetite from the AFL, or its 18 club presidents, to re-negotiate or rubber stump a new deal that allows those timelines to be extended, or for the stadium clause to be removed. \"If those contractual terms can't be met, there's no Plan B. There is no understanding from the club that a re-negotiation would be entered into,\" Ms McCann said. The AFL has been contacted for comment. The stadium, at Macquarie Point, is a condition for the team to play in the competition, the AFL says.(Tasmanian government) Former Richmond champion Jack Riewoldt has been working with the Devils on an advisory basis. He said the club remained focused on taking to the field in 2028 but was wary of the unfolding political situation. \"It's critically important for us to exist,\" he said of the stadium. Jack Riewoldt says the club remains focused on taking to the field in 2028.(ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke) Champion woodchopper David Foster has also been recruited to the club as part of a 'posters and coasters' campaign in pubs and clubs across the north-west. \"We're our own worst enemy, to be honest with you,\" he said. The stadium is considered pivotal to the club's financial viability and was first floated by the Tasmanian AFL taskforce as part of its original bid for a license. Amidst speculation that Labor may attempt to pivot to thealternate Stadium 2.0 proposal, the ABC understands the party has communicated to the Devils that was unequivocally not in their plans. Stakeholders and unions have expressed their concern that the stadium is now under a dark cloud. The stadium was first floated by the Tasmanian AFL taskforce as part of its original bid for a license.(Supplied: MPDC) \"I envisaged there being a decade's worth of work off the back of a stadium, and that sures up a lot of work for our members into the future,\" said Construction, Forestry and Maritime Employees Union organiser Ritchie Hassett. Footy fans have reacted to the no-confidence motion with scorn too. In a post on a popular pro-stadium social media page which boasts 23,000 members, administrator Mark Brown said Opposition leader Dean Winter and Labor member for Clark Josh Willie has been booted from the group. Labor has supported the government's plans to build a stadium as part of its deal with the AFL since early last year. In parliament, Mr Winter insisted that the no-confidence motion was not about the stadium or team. Dean Winter says you can't have the team without the stadium.(ABC News: Luke Bowden) \"You can have the leader of the Greens, and the Greens and others, saying 'yes team, no stadium' but its not true. They know its not true,\" he said. \"In order for our state to get an AFL team, we need a stadium and that's why it's not in our motion. \"We supported the premier in building the stadium that he wanted to do, but that's not what this motion is about.\" Just like the yellow brick road in The Wizard of Oz, Tasmanian Treasurer Guy Barnett's \"sensible pathway to surplus\" in his recent budget appears almost fantastical, or at least extremely optimistic. This afternoon, the Greens attempted to pass an amendment to the motion that would have made specific reference to the stadium, but that was voted down 25 votes to 10. Mr Rockliff has previously indicated that if a no-confidence motion was passed against him, he would seek to call an election, but whether that happens remains to be seen. He may decide to resign his leadership and allow a fellow Liberal party member take his place \u2014 but that would require the support of the house. Amongst the leading candidates is the minister responsible for the stadium, Eric Abetz, but whether he would have the support of the house is unclear.",

        "raw_text": "The future of Tasmania's AFL club may be in doubt as the proposed Macquarie Point stadium is used as a pawnin the state's ongoing political stoush. But there's a campaign building for another sports team the Apple Isle could throw its support behind that won't rely on new infrastructure being built. A no-confidence motion in Tasmanian premier Jeremy Rockliff appears set to succeed. Follow the coverage live. For several years, Netball Tasmania has been vocal about its desire to join the Super Netball league. Whenthe Collingwood Magpies were disbandedat the end of the 2023 season, they left a hole that had to be filled in order for the elite domestic competition to fulfil its broadcast deal. Netball Tasmania, Netball ACT and the Gold Coast Titans all expressed their interest in the spot, before each party pulled out of the race due to time pressures. Ultimately,the eighth licence was awarded to Craig Hutchison's media company SENand the Melbourne Mavericks were born. The process opened a can of worms about expansion, as people started to speculate what might be possible beyond 2026 when the league's current partnership with Fox Netball ends. Netball Australia says it is exploring all possibilities when it comes to expansion \u2014 whether that be incorporating more Australian or New Zealand teams. Here is the case for Super Netball to expand into Tasmania in the coming years. Although Netball Tasmania wasn't quite ready two years ago to enter the league, the conversations had around that time made the member organisation aware of the kinds of things they needed to put in place for the next opportunity. The Melbourne Mavericks have played one home game in Hobart the last two years.(Getty: Steve Bell) Similarly to what Hawthorn and North Melbourne have done in the AFL over the last decade, Collingwood had a Super Netball agreement in place with Tasmania to take one of their home games per season to the state. Games would be played at either at the Silverdome in Launceston (capacity 3,255) or the Derwent Entertainment Centre in Hobart (capacity 4,500). That tradition has now been carried on by the Mavericks. At their round six game against the Queensland Firebirds in Hobart, the official crowd was 2,857 and it's expected this number would grow if Tasmanians had their own team to barrack for. These two stadiums offer more seating than the Sunshine Coast Lightning currently have at their home venue, so they'd be the perfect size for a start-up Tasmanian side. Additionally, due to the fact that the Tasmanian Wild already exist as a team in the Super Netball Reserves competition, the existing club infrastructure means a Tasmanian Super Netball team would be less expensive to establish and would save taxpayers money. Tasmania has increased its netball participation base by 10 per cent over the last two years, taking its total number in 2024 to just shy of 10,000. Although it may have a much smaller pool of athletes than other member organisations around the country, the state punches above its weight. Five Tasmanian players were selected in this year's Australian under-17 and under-19 squads. The Magpies also played in Tasmania before they were disbanded.(AAP:\u00a0James Ross) \"I believe it would be a really compelling proposition to have our whole state united for a female-led sport,\" Netball Tasmania CEO Mitch Coulson told ABC Sport. \"Tasmania is well and truly on the radar of other sports so we want to make sure netball can grab a piece of that and that we stand our ground. \"The reality is yes, we have a smaller participation base, but I think everyone here has a strong resolve to prove that we can produce athletes as good as anyone else. \"They work so hard \u2014 if not harder \u2014 to push themselves to a standard that gets them noticed, but the big question beyond that is still, where does that lead?\" Currently there are 10 full-time playing contracts for each of Super Netball's eight teams. There is also an extra six-month full-time contract for an 11th player on offer and roughly four training partner contracts per club. Five Tasmanian athletes were picked across the Australian U17s and U19s squads after impressing at nationals.(Supplied: Netball Tasmania) When you compare that ratio with netball's one million participants nationwide, it is clear just how difficult it is to break through to the top. Coulson said Tasmania would therefore be open to signing a Super Netball roster that blends talent from their state and elsewhere. Funding of course is a big factor, but the member organisation is already in discussions about obtaining that cash and is also considering private equity stakes and ownership. \"For the size of its participation, the number of professional netball contracts is extremely disproportionate compared to other codes, and to attract the best female athletes, we argue a team here would also be beneficial for the broader game,\" Coulson said. \"We believe we've earned it \u2026 We've had multiple years with growth in participation and there's lots of other codes making noise down here, so it's an interesting time for Tasmanian sport.\" Super Netball is looking to find its eighth team for 2024 by June 20 to replace Collingwood, but is there enough time to set-up a competitive and sustainable side? The Tasmanian Wild will compete at the upcoming Super Netball Reserves play-in tournament and extended finals weekend that takes place from June 16-22. Super Netball Reserves is in its second season and runs across seven rounds as a tier two competition, contested by eight academy teams aligned with the Super Netball clubs. Tasmania, ACT and the Northern Territory have only been invited to the back end of the tournament and will play each other once to determine how they will be ranked for the finals weekend against the Reserves sides. This format will replace the Australian Netball Championships this year as the governing body reassesses its pathway offering. As a result, the three state-based sides have less opportunity to play. Coulson is pushing for Tasmania to be incorporated for the full tournament next year. \"Although the bigger dream is to get into the fully fledged Super Netball competition, our addition to the Reserves format would serve as an ideal launching pad,\" he said. In the meantime, another step Netball Tasmania took this year was to form an alliance with Netball South Australia. This, they hoped, would create a pathway for their athletes to the top level as they work towards their own Super Netball team. Charlotte Walker and Ellie Marshall (both right) are part of the Adelaide Thunderbirds Futures team.(Supplied: Adelaide Thunderbirds) Two athletes who have been picked up already include Ellie Marshall and Charlotte Walker, who have been playing for the Adelaide Thunderbirds in Super Netball Reserves. Walker has already had a stellar year. She was signed as a training partner to the senior side of the two-time premiership winning club and made the Australian under-19 squad after an impressive campaign at nationals. At the Thunderbirds, she has been learning from the very best. Australian under-21 head coach Cathy Fellows is an assistant there and Walker was also training alongside star Jamaican duo Shamera Sterling-Humphrey and Latanya Wilson in the lead-up to the season. Walker is now in the frame for selection for the 2025 Netball World Youth Cup. Shamera Sterling-Humphrey, Matilda Garrett, Cathy Fellows and Latanya Wilson are the best defensive team in Super Netball.(Getty: Kelly Defina) \"Unfortunately, Tasmania doesn't have its own Super Netball environment, so this step up in another state has been huge for me,\" Walker told ABC Sport. \"I've been getting advice from some of the best defenders in the world \u2014 they've taught me how much I can contest outside the circle, that's really opened my eyes \u2014 and I've been practising against some of the best shooters in the league too. \"Growing up I never imagined in a million years that I could get picked as a training partner, so I think if our state had a team, it wouldn't seem so out of reach. \"Until then, I can't see anything wrong with being friendly with every state and trying to create more of these partnerships, because it opens up more opportunity. \"Even having a Tasmanian Reserves side would also offer us that higher competition as well.\"",

        "raw_text": "A country's football team is rarely, if ever, made up of its 11 best players. International managers have their 'favourites', and with good reason. Seldom do they spend more than a week with their squads, and often, especially at the pointy end of World Cup qualification, there is too much riding on games to forgo a safe pair of hands for the sweaty palms of a debutant. Despite throwing a few selection curveballs in each of the four Socceroos squads he has named since taking over last September, Tony Popovic's favourites are now well established, particularly in attack. Nishan Velupillay, although missing this window through injury, has been both the biggest surprise and success of the early Popovic months, Mitch Duke and Adam Taggart have been in and around all of Popovic's starting 11s despite up and down club form, while Martin Boyle, who has just finished an excellent season with Hibernian in Scotland, has deservedly been an ever present on the right wing. Velupillay has scored three goals in five international games since his debut in October 2024.(Getty Images: Darrian Traynor) This week, the Socceroos face Japan on Thursday and then Saudi Arabia on Tuesday in the last two matches of round three of Asian World Cup Qualifying. Australia currently sit second in their group and must stay there to earn automatic qualification to next year's tournament. Two draws would be enough to do it, but lose either of the games, and things get difficult. If the Socceroos do fall out of the top two positions, they will enter the fourth round of qualifying, which could end in a dreaded qualification play-off. So, it's both understandable and predictable that Popovic looks set to lean on his attacking in-circle once again this week. But waiting in the wings (and growing increasingly impatient in them) sits an exhilarating crop of uncapped forward talent the likes of which Australian football hasn't seen for decades. Last season, for the first time ever, the top four positions of the A-League's golden boot standings were taken up by Australians under the age of 24. Sydney's Adrian Segecic (20) and the Wanderers' Nicolas Milanovic (23) \u2014 who last month made the move to Europe with Scottish club Aberdeen \u2014 both had excellent seasons cutting in from the wing, while Adelaide's Archie Goodwin (20) and Western's Noah Botic (23) had breakout years as their teams' attacking focal points. Milanovic (right) was named the A-League's player of the season for his exploits with Western Sydney.(Getty Images: Steve Christo) However, all are yet to make their international debuts and won't against Saudi Arabia or Japan. Milanovic was included in the Socceroos pre-camp training squad earlier this month, but didn't make the final cut for the international window proper, while Botic and Segecic weren't named in either. Goodwin, meanwhile, succumbed to a hamstring injury while playing for Adelaide last month. Segecic's and Botic's non-selections have been talking points for a couple of international windows now. Both made 'call-me' goalscoring celebrations after missing selection for Popovic's March squad and Segecic recently told ESPN that he hadn't heard from the Socceroos boss at all despite his stellar year. Segecic sent a message to Popovic after his omission from the squad for March's international window.(Getty Images: Ayush Kumar) \"I think I wanted to be part of it \u2026 maybe I thought I deserved to at least be a part of the training squad. But that's football, and that's how it goes. I can only keep training, doing well, and hope to be part of something next time,\" Segecic told ESPN. \"I think any footballer, if they were in my shoes, having done what they had done, would love to have had a call-up. \"I would say it's frustrating, but it is what it is. That's football. You just have to keep going and not put your head down.\" Injuries to Velupillay and veteran Craig Goodwin as well as the deepening career crisis of Kusini Yengi \u2014 who's without a club and short of match fitness after being let go by Portsmouth last month \u2014 meant that there were three vacant attacking spots in Popovic's latest squad. In an exciting move, Popovic opted to reward 21-year-old centre-forward Mohamed Toure for his strong season in the Danish first division. Nine goals and three assists for Randers makes him one of the Socceroos most in-form European based players. Toure's only international cap came against England in 2023.(Getty Images: Tom Dulat) The only other two out and out strikers named in the squad were Popovic favourites Taggart and Duke. Taggart had, by his standards, a quiet A-League season. He scored 10 goals over the course of the year but only found the net three times after the last international break in March. The 35-year-old Duke, meanwhile, comes into the window off the back of the most club football he's played for well over a year. It's still not much, mind you. He's registered just 383 minutes, mostly as a late substitute, for his Japanese team Machida Zelvia all season. He's scored one goal in that time. Taggart could be in line for a start against Japan on Thursday night.(Getty Images: Mark Metcalfe) In all of Popovic's six games in charge of the Socceroos to date, he has played a variation of a 3-4-2-1 formation. This means that his side always features three main attacking players in the form of one striker and two supporting wide men. That's unlikely to change this week. The striking spot will be taken by one of Taggart, Duke, Toure, or, perhaps most likely, Brandon Borrello. Borrello, although most comfortable on the wing, started up front for the Socceroos in their last game against China in March. Nishan Velupillay is firing the Socceroos towards the 2026 FIFA World Cup with his qualification goals, but his biggest impact on football in Australia will be felt in generations to come. He's not quite a natural centre-forward but is a strong presser and hard worker. Either side of that focal point, the Socceroos boss changes the job description depending on the game. Sometimes the wide players are asked to play as somewhat traditional wingers, sometimes as inside forwards and sometimes as more withdrawn, duelling playmakers. Given the magnitude of the upcoming games and the quality of opposition, it is safe to assume that selection will be more on the conservative side. Riley McGree, although just back from injury, is a possible option to provide both support to the midfield and add guile in attack. On the right, Boyle is the favourite to start. He's a hard worker and will provide some pace on the counter. Borrello performed well in the Socceroos 2-0 defeat of China in March.(Getty Images: Lintao Zhang) Regardless of what happens against Saudi Arabia and Japan, Australia's attacking questions are unlikely to be answered this week. But if things go to plan, and the Socceroos clinch automatic World Cup qualification still over a year out from the tournament, we could be a step closer to finding them. Because perhaps then, with the peril of qualification play-offs avoided and with 12 glorious months of friendlies ahead of his team, Popovic will see fit to bed in Australia's next generation of goal scorers.",

        "raw_text": "Sunia Turuva says he regrets using social media to mock Lachlan Galvin for leaving Wests Tigers and patched things up with the teen star before he joined Canterbury. Turuva and teammate Jarome Luai took to their Instagram stories to criticise the five-eighth's call to reject the Tigers' offer of a rich contract extension in April. The pair of swipes led to suggestions of a divide among the Tigers' playing group, with Galvin's management later serving the club a legal letter over bullying claims. One of the NRL's most upbeat characters, Turuva has since moved on from the drama, preparing to face former club Penrith for the first time on Sunday as Galvin eyes a possible Bulldogs debut a day later. Turuva admits if he had his time again, he would not have taken aim at his then-teammate, whose release from the Tigers was finally confirmed last week. \"Looking back on it, I wouldn't have done the post in the first place,\" the winger said. \"I didn't think of what he was going through at the time. I'm happy to see where he's at now and happy for the club as well, we're able to move on.\" Turuva addressed the matter with Galvin before the teenager officially joined Canterbury as the NRL's biggest mid-season signing in recent memory. \"We did speak about it, just trying to say that the club is bigger, trying to move on,\" he said. \"For myself, I thought it was a joke, but looking back on it now, I've got to be a bigger person. \"Just seeing where he's at now, I think it's a really good spot for him. It's a really good spot for the club as well. For us and for him, it's just good to move on now. We're able to leave it in our past.\" Illness sidelined Luai from training on Wednesday but Turuva says he'll return for Friday's session and take the field on Sunday against the Panthers, where the duo were key members of the premiership dynasty. \"(Luai) has got the man flu,\" Turuva explained. \"We'll see him here on Friday. He'll be sweet (to play).\" ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines. Turuva said former teammate Brian To'o began sledging him as soon as he came from the field after Penrith's 18-10 defeat of Parramatta on Sunday. \"He's been messaging me each day,\" Turuva said. \"(He's) already trying to play mind games, trying to send photos from last year of me in the Panthers jersey. He's trying to tell me not to forget where I came from. \"Yesterday, he said if they score on me he's going to bring me into their celebration. Hopefully Jeral (Skelton, To'o's opposite winger) can score on him and I can bring him into ours.\" Edge defence has been a particular issue for Penrith this season, though the four-time reigning premiers showed improvement in the defeat of the Eels. Turuva is hoping to cash in. \"Scoring a couple of tries against the old team would be pretty good,\" Turuva said. AAP",

        "raw_text": "Two country colts football teams in South West WA have drawn for the third time in a row \u2014 a statistical feat a mathematician is calling a one-in-a-million event. The Dunsborough Sharks were ahead for almost the entire game on Saturday but a fourth quarter surge gave the Augusta Margaret River (AMR) Hawks the lead. A rushed behind brought the Sharks level in the last minute of play, finishing the game 65 to 65. The result came after two similar deadlocks, with the clubs unable to be separated in both their encounters last season. The Dunsborough Sharks and Augusta Margaret River Hawks are evenly matched.(Supplied: Kirstin Zan) The South West Football League said it believed the string of results was a first in national football history. He said the two young sides had matched each other goal-for-goal. \"In the first round last year it was 8-4 to 8-4, then in the second round it was 9-5 to 9-5, and then on the weekend it was 10-5 to 10-5,\" he said. Dunsborough only joined the competition in 2022, meaning the teams had played each other a total of seven times. Nearly half of those games have been drawn. Mathematician Adam Spencer said the chances of two teams drawing three times in a row was one-in-a-million. \"Across the AFL/VFL, consistently about one per cent of games are drawn \u2026 so one in a hundred,\" he said. \"The odds of two draws in a row for the same two teams are one in ten thousand. Dr Spencer said it was almost impossible to figure out the exact odds of it having occurred elsewhere in Australia given the sheer number of leagues and levels. But he said, based on the assumption that about 100,000 games were played every year, there was a 95 per cent chance it had never happened before. Augusta Margaret River Hawks and Dunsborough Sharks face off at the weekend.(Supplied: Kirstin Zan) Dunsborough Colts coach Steve Dale said it took a while to dawn on him what had happened. \"Initially I suppose I was disappointed that we didn't actually win the game,\" he said. \"But then of course, we all started looking at the score. Dale said it was the first draw he had been involved in as either a coach or player. Grant Garstone says both teams have a lot of young players.(Supplied: Kirstin Zan) He took the reins of the young Dunsborough side earlier this year, making him their third coach since the start of 2024 \u2014 a fact not lost on AMR Colts coach Grant Garstone. \"I've seen a different coach every time and yeah I just can't seem to beat them and they can't get me.\" Garstone said the teams appeared to be very evenly matched, which he speculated could be tied to the fact that both clubs were keen to give younger players a run. Both coaches have vowed to end the draw streak when the teams face off again in August.(Supplied: Kirstin Zan) \"We're playing a lot of kids that should still or could still be playing under 17s or year 11s and 12s now and I think Dunsborough, they must be doing the same,\" he said. Both agreed Saturday's draw was in many ways the fairest result \u2014 Dunsborough having dominated the first half, AMR owning the second. It was the opposite of their previous match-up when Dunsborough came from behind in the last 10 minutes with four goals in a row. But with their next face-off coming up in August, the rival coaches have drawn a line in the sand. \"I think there are going to be a lot of people [who] come down and watch it because obviously everyone's hoping for a fourth draw but we want to get a win,\" Dale said. \"I don't want to do four in a row, that's for sure,\" Garstone said. Dr Spencer said it was so statistically unlikely that he would bet his house the two teams would not draw their next game.",

However, their women's team were scheduled to play in Melbourne that weekend against Collingwood instead. GWS's executive general manager of AFLW and football operations, Alison Zell, said while she understood double-headers might not work for all clubs, it would have been feasible from the Giants' perspective and helped grow their fanbase. \"We're a young club with a new audience, a new fan base, and we want to be able to build that across our men's and women's program,\" Zell told ABC Sport. \"We think we've got this great prospect and a unique proposition to be able to bring new fans in by showcasing the men's and women's games together. \"That's why we're really disappointed to not get the opportunity to do that this season.\" The Giants feel double-headers would have appealed to their fan base.(Getty: Quinn Rooney) The week prior, the Giants' AFL and VFL teams play in the Gold Coast, while the women's team open their season the same day in Canberra. \"We've now got three teams across two different states on the one day,\" Zell said, as clubs share staff and resources across the programs. \"So from a board level, from an executive level, people have to choose \u2014 or potentially choose \u2014 which game they can attend. And what you don't want is people who represent the club, or who work for the club, having to choose which program they work on or they'd rather be at.\" Just over a month before the new fixture release, AFLW general manager Emma Moore said a key strategy of the league was aiming to foster a \"one club, two teams\" approach. \"While we're working through the fixture, one of the things we're focusing on is optimising what we can do in terms of the crossover of the women's and men's competition, and clearly double-headers are part of that conversation,\" Moore said at the season opener announcement. Demons players enjoy time with fans at Princes Park.(Getty: Kelly Defina) Moore added they wanted to help drive current fans of the men's competition to the women's games. However, when the women's fixture came out, in lieu of double-headers, flexible timing was built into the crossover period to ensure a club's men's and women's sides would not play at the exact same time. AFLPA interim chief executive Ben Smith said the union provided the AFL with a submission based on player feedback that included a desire for more \"category-one venues and the opportunity to play some double-headers\". Last season, Richmond star Grace Egan told The Age: \"I don't think I've talked to a girl that hasn't loved it (the idea of a double-header).\" Players have also consistently advocated for some marquee games to be played at larger stadiums after the league moved away from their use to prioritise suburban grounds. The benefits include they are weather protected, particularly out of the wind, have better surfaces free from hard and soft patches, and greater amenities for fans, such as public transport access. Moreover, these grounds also have camera cabling in much better positions, which can elevate the broadcast quality. Essendon and Hawthorn's inaugural 2022 clash at Docklands attracted 12,092 spectators, yet just 3,778 when the clubs played each other in Frankston the following year. In the same vein, the first Showdown in 2022 between the Crows and Power attracted over 20,000 spectators at Adelaide Oval. Yet last year's Showdown housed just 5,194 at a sold-out Alberton Oval. Adelaide and Port Adelaide's inaugural showdown attracted over 20,000 people to Adelaide Oval.(Getty: Sarah Reed/AFL Photos) Last year, AFL executive general manager of football Laura Kanetold The Sydney Morning Herald that forfuture AFLW matches to be played at Docklands Stadium, games would need to attract 20,000 supporters to justify using the venue. Clubs like GWS feel double-headers provide a chance to try and reach that target. \"We know that there's a lot of complexities that come with this. We know it's a really hard prospect to put the fixtures together [and] the AFL haven't ruled out double-headers into the future,\" Zell said. \"We just think it was a missed opportunity, particularly in our market, to do it this year, to really capitalise on the fact that we're coming back into the men's season.\" ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

Sicily has succumbed to a \"hip/abdominal\" issue that the Hawks said flared up afterlast week's 51-point thrashing at the hands of Collingwood. The versatile defender will miss key clashes with the Western Bulldogs on Thursday night and Adelaide eight days later, before a bye in round 15.

James Sicily's injury issues flared up after Hawthorn's loss to Collingwood last week.(Getty Images: Josh Chadwick) The Hawks' fourth-year coach lashed reports of a groin complaint as a \"storm in a teacup\", and stressed Sicily's kicking, in particular, had not been affected. Sicily's injury status was updated on Tuesday, with the club now hoping he will be fit to return to action against North Melbourne in round 16. On Wednesday, Mitchell said it was \"completely wrong\" to suggest Hawthorn had been dishonest about Sicily's fitness. \"At no point [previously] has he ever been a chance to not play, so that was my frustration last week,\" Mitchell said. Mitchell reiterated Hawthorn had not considered leaving Sicily out of the team until this week. \"It hasn't even been close,\" he said. \"There's injuries where [it is a case of], 'Is he going to get to the line?' and, 'Is he going to be able to play this week?' \u2014 and he's never been in that category.

Back then, Vine was also lighting up A-League Women with Sydney FC. But between taking a mental health break, injuries and a difficult start to life in the NWSL with North Carolina Courage, the 27-year-old has not played for the Matildas since the Paris Olympics.

        "raw_text": "Aryna Sabalenka is the top-ranked player in women's tennis. Yet even that status did not spare her from competing in front of empty seats at Roland-Garros. The three-time major singles champion faced China's Zheng Qinwen in the first quarterfinal match on Tuesday, beginning at 11am (local time) on Court Philippe-Chatrier. When play began, large sections of the 15,000-seat stadium were still unoccupied. It is a common sight in the early hours at the French Open, when many ticket holders opt for lunch or arrive later in the day. \"It was a big match and probably would make more sense to put us a little bit later just so more people could watch it,\" Sabalenka said after her 7-6 (7/3), 6-3 win. \"I definitely think that would make more sense to kind of like move our match for a little bit later.\" Aryna Sabalenka played in front of a sparse crowd in her quarterfinal against \u00a0Zheng Qinwen.(Getty Images: Robert Prange) But scheduling more night sessions for women is proving a tough issue to resolve for French Open tournament director Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo. Since the introduction of night sessions in 2021, only four women's singles matches have been featured in that marquee time slot. Serena Williams played in the first night match at Roland-Garros, but pandemic restrictions meant the stands were empty. No women's matches have been scheduled for the evening session this year, which Sabalenka said needed to be changed. Asked about her views on the fact that women have not played a single night match this year, the Belarusian said they deserved \"equal treatment.\" \"There was a lot of \u2026 great battles, a lot of great matches which would be cool to see as night sessions,\" Sabalenka said. \"Just more people in the stands watching these incredible battles. And just to show ourselves to more people. I definitely agree that we deserve to be put on a bigger stage. Like better timing, more people watching.\" Sabalenka plays defending champion and fifth seed Iga \u015awi\u0105tek in the semifinals. \u015awi\u0105tek, chasing a fifth French Open title, defeated 13th seed Elina Svitolina of Ukraine 6-1, 7-5. American Francis Tiafoe said tennis rules lacked consistency after Lorenzo Musetti escaped punishment for kicking a ball that struck a line official in his quarterfinal victory. The incident occurred in the second set of their match when Musetti was given balls to serve. The Italian kicked one with his left leg and inadvertently hit a line judge, who barely flinched even though she was hit on her upper body. Lorenzo Musetti avoided further punishment after kicking a ball during his quarterfinal with Frances Tiafoe.(Getty Images: Adam Pretty) Musetti apologised and was immediately given a warning for unsportsmanlike conduct by the chair umpire. But he was not defaulted and the incident drew comparisons to another involving Novak Djokovic at the 2020 US Open. A petulant swipe at the ball after having his serve broken brought an end to Djokovic's campaign in New York five years ago after he struck a line judge in the throat. \"Obviously he [Musetti] did that and nothing happened,\" Tiafoe told reporters after his 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 defeat. \"I think that's comical, but it is what it is. Nothing happened, so there's nothing really to talk about. \"Obviously, it's not consistent, so it is what it is.\" Musetti said it was an \"unlucky coincidence\". \"I immediately went to the line umpire, and I of course said sorry, I apologised to everyone,\" Musetti said. \"It was right to have a warning, but I think the umpire saw that there was no intention about that, and that's why probably just let me continue my game.\" Musetti will next face defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, who advanced to the semifinals via a 6-0, 6-1, 6-4 victory over 12th seed Tommy Paul.

        "raw_text": "I don't know about you, but the times of having to quarantine due to COVID-19 feel like a distant memory. But around this time each year, we're reminded that the virus is still active, as are many other serious respiratory illnesses during \"flu season\". There have been more than 65,000 cases of COVID-19 so far this year nationwide, more than 81,000 Influenza cases and 50,000 cases of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), according to theAustralian Respiratory Surveillance Report. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also designateda new strainknown as NB.1.8.1, which is now the dominant variant in China and Hong Kong, as a \"variant under monitoring\". So, what has changed when it comes to quarantine rules? And do you still have to isolate if you or a family member has a respiratory illness? Advanced epidemiologist Anne Maree Baldwin says we're in a different situation now than five years ago whenCOVID-19 first arrived in Australia. \"We hada new virus in a population without immunity, which was expected to have devastating impacts,\" says the public health expert from the Sunshine Coast/Kabi Kabi lands. \"But now all or almost all of the population has some immunity to COVID through vaccination and having the disease.\" We areno longer required by law to quarantine or isolatewhen we have COVID-19. But Ms Baldwin says it is recommended. \"Stay home and away from others when you have symptoms, irrespective of whether it's COVID or another respiratory illness,\" she says. \"If you must go out, we ask people towear a mask, avoid indoor or crowded situations, and keep away from others as best you can.\" Dr Libby Sander says some employees feel obligated to go back to work when they're still sick. Dr Libby Sander is an associate professor of organisational behaviour at Bond University on the Gold Coast/Kombumerri. She says there has been a culture shift since the pandemic back to a place where someemployees feel obligated to go back to workeven if they're unwell. \"I'm often hearing [about instances] where people are being expected to go to work when they're sick because of staff shortages or they just feel obliged to go in because of the workload. \"If you are sick, you shouldn't go to work, no-one wants you to make them sick.\" You can beinfectious with respiratory illness from up to 48 hours before your symptoms start. So, if you've had a loved one or housemate at home who's been unwell, should you go to work? The US has recently dropped the COVID vaccine recommendation for healthy children and pregnant women. Here's what the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation says. Ms Baldwin saysit comes down to organisational policy. \"Just communicating first and foremost, so everyone's aware,\" she says. \"In general, quarantine isn't needed if exposed to COVID, we just ask that you stay away from others if you develop symptoms.\" She says it's particularly important to avoid people more likely to get severely sick, includingimmunocompromised people, older people, infants, and pregnant women. Dr Sander says working from home arrangements can provide people with security and flexibility. \"If you're not really unwell you can keep working, you're not worrying about infecting other people \u2026 so I think flexibility is really important.\" In general, you don't automatically need to take arapid antigen test (RAT)after being around someone who's been sick. But it is recommended if you start developing symptoms or are planning on visiting a high-risk setting like aged care facilities, disability care, hospitals, or other healthcare settings. Ms Baldwin saystesting is important for people who are either very sick or need antiviral medicine. A Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) designed to test for both COVID-19 as well as influenza virus A and B.(ABC News: Abbey Haberecht) \"We have the RAT tests and they're widely available now in supermarkets and pharmacies, often for about $10,\" she says. \"Some can test for four viruses,Influenza strains A and B, COVID and RSV. \"The RATs are helpful for a quick result, which is important when the COVID and influenza antiviral should be started in a day or two of symptom onset.\" A diagnosis forwhooping coughrequires aPCR test(polymerase chain reaction) from a GP to receive the necessary antibiotics. Chief medical officer at Healthdirect Australia, Nirvana Luckraj, says if you have tested positive for respiratory illness, \"you should stay at home until all of your acute symptoms have gone\". She says acute symptoms includesneezing, coughingand asore throat. \"If you still have acute symptoms like a cough after seven days, you may still be infectious. You shouldcontinue to wear a maskandphysically distance whenever possible.\" Our experts say it's important to prepare yourself each year. \"We see COVID waves and whooping cough at any time of the year and most RSV is actually at this time of year,\" Ms Baldwin says. \"So being prepared is important andthe best way to do that is vaccinate.\" You can get both the COVID and influenza vaccines at the same appointment \u2014 theAustralian Department of Health advisesthat it is safe to do this and doctors and pharmacists will now allow this.

        "raw_text": "When you go to see Kerry Lyons for support, Chives is there to help you too. He's an 11-year-old Devon Rex cat, and works with Kerry, who is an accredited social worker in Brisbane/Meanjin, as part of her feline-assisted therapy program. \"Cats can have a really calming and gentle presence in the therapy room, but they also need the people around them to be emotionally regulated,\" says Ms Lyons. Assisted therapy is just one context in which \"therapy cats\" are becoming increasingly common. They're also paying visit to facilities such as aged-care homes and hospitals, and being registered as assistance animals. So what makes cats so therapeutic and how do they compare to other therapy animals? Bandit might just be the coolest cat in town, attending festivals and frequenting shops and cafes. But to her owner Anthorr, Bandit is much more than an adventure buddy, she's his support to leave the house each day. Animal-assisted services may help manage disability, illness and suffering, according to Animal Therapies Ltd. That can include autism, post-traumatic stress disorder, and asthma, for example. The organisation's founder Wendy Coombe explains in some contexts, the person working with the animal is a health professional, while in others, such as visitation to facilities including aged care, the human doesn't necessarily require a qualification. \"There are different types of animal-assisted practitioners that are working alongside cats \u2014 and what type of service they are delivering depends on the human qualifications of that registered health professional,\" Ms Coombe says. \"Then you have other professionals who might be teachers or educators, and they've undertaken an animal-assisted learning certified course and are delivering skills, development or training and may have cats as part of that.\" For example, someone in a farm setting teaching a person how to regulate their emotions in the presence of a horse. There are only a handful of government-registered assistance cats, which Ms Coombe says \"help alleviate disabilities of handlers, that meet the standards of hygiene and behaviour\". Chives enjoys meeting new people, owner Kerry says.(Supplied) Ms Lyons works primarily with children and young adults, focusing on emotional regulation, connection, social skills, problem solving and confidence. She became interested in feline-assisted therapy when she noticed Chives offering comfort to clients in her waiting room, which is also connected to her husband's at-home acupuncture clinic. \"During COVID in the early days, our family cat would sit in the waiting area in her favourite spot on a long bench, and almost without fail, every client that was sitting waiting would pat her and say to me 'I don't normally like cats, but this one is different.'\" Ms Lyons says Chives isn't \"necessarily different\", but that she did notice how calming and friendly they were at a time when people were really stressed. And while people commonly think of dogs and horses in animal assisted therapies, Ms Lyons says cats offer something unique. \"Horses are a prey animal, so they have really highly refined nervous systems \u2014 that impacts how they interact with people. \"Then dogs are actually [considered] predators, and have developed with people. Their relational skills are really important in their work.\" Cats, on the other hand, are both prey and predator, Ms Lyons says. As a result, cats need to feel safe, and need those around them to be emotionally regulated. But at the same time, Ms Lyons says, they have a lot to offer in terms of calmness and connection. She says there is evidence to show their soft touch andpurr is soothing. Animal Therapies Ltd's Ms Coombe says cats are ideal for visiting schools, hospitals and care homes, where larger animals might not be suitable or where there are people whomight be afraid of dogs. People in aged care often miss the warmth a cat can provide, says Ms Coombe.(Pexels) She says cats being able to sit on someone's lap means they can provide that \"close touch and warmth with another living thing\". \"That is what a lot of people in aged care miss. \"Interacting with an animal in that context in a very positive way can increase oxytocin \u2026 and reduce cortisol which is the stress [hormone].\" Not every cat is suited to working in animal-assisted therapy, explains Ms Coombe. An animal is assessed to ensure they are safe to interact with a client base, and to ensure it is comfortable in those situations. \"If they show any signs of stress, then they are not suitable for this kind of work,\" Ms Coombe says. \"We can't compromise on the safety of the human or the welfare of the animal.\" Kerry says Chives is a soothing presence for clients.(Supplied) Ms Lyons says working in animal-assisted therapy, it's the human's duty to consider the welfare of the animal as much as the client. Regina Hall-Jones is a cat behaviour consultant and says some cats thrive on having interactions with new people. \"While most cats do like a secure, familiar environment, others like seeing new things and enjoy going out.\" And while a cat's personality is not always breed-based, Ms Hall-Jones says breeds such as Bengals are more likely to be happier travelling outside of the home. Ms Lyons says Chives enjoys meeting new people and experiencing new smells. \"She chose this work herself, that's what started my journey.\"",

        "summary": "Renters in Tasmania are not required to have their carpets professionally cleaned at the end of their lease, despite that condition being included on many rental contracts, the Residential Tenancy Commissioner has ruled. The Tenants Union has welcomed the decision, saying it's the first definitive ruling on the matter.",
        "raw_text": "Tasmanian tenants are not necessarily required to have their carpets professionally cleaned when they vacate their rental property, despite \"almost all\" leases saying they are, a ruling has found. In a recent bond dispute regarding a Burnie property, the Residential Tenancy Commissioner found the tenant is only required to have the carpet professionally cleaned if they leave it in a worse state than when they began their lease. \"A tenant is not responsible for carpet cleaning performed as a matter of general practice as opposed to any real need or genuine failure of the tenant, in accordance with their obligations,\" it states. A tenancy law expert says it could be illegal in several states, while tenants\u2019 advocates say it preys on vulnerable renters during Australia\u2019s housing crisis. The Tenants Union of Tasmania, which represented the tenant, said this was the first definitive ruling on the matter and was a legally enforceable decision. \"It really shines a light that a blanket clause in standard tenancy agreements that says you have to have premises professionally cleaned is invalid,\" Tenants Union senior solicitor Andrew Smith said. \"A tenant has the right not to do it, if they've left it in the same condition as when they moved in and there's proof of that. Andrew Smith says standardised leases which include the stipulation were commonplace.(ABC News: Ashleigh Barraclough) Mr Smith said despite the ruling, the condition to have carpets professionally cleaned was appearing in leases \"all the time\", as it was in the standard lease provided to landlords by the Real Estate Institute of Tasmania. \"It is in the standard Real Estate Institute lease almost all real estate agents will use and a lot of private landlords will choose to use, even some social housing providers are using these leases,\" he said. The Real Estate Institute of Tasmania has declined to comment. The tenant had argued the same principle should apply to fumigation as carpet cleaning, but the commissioner disagreed.(Pixabay:Jarmoluk) In the case that led to this ruling, the Residential Tenancy Commissioner said the owner had provided a photo of a \"small yellow stain on the carpet of one of the bedrooms, which was not recorded in the ingoing condition report\". But no other photos had been supplied showing the condition of the carpet at the end of the tenant's lease. Hence, the commissioner said the tenant was only responsible for the cost of cleaning that one stain. \"I will award an amount I consider reasonable given the stain in question is very small, even when photographed close up,\" the ruling states. \"The owner is awarded $25 for carpet cleaning.\" The commissioner ruled fumigation was a \"necessary measure\" to remove pests, dry skin and other allergens associated with pets at the end of a lease.(Submitted: Elizabeth Stevenson) The case also dealt with the cost of fumigating the property, given the tenant had a pet. Humans have been living alongside cats and dogs for thousands of years. But that doesn't mean we're always compatible. What can you do as an animal lover with pet allergies? The tenant had argued the same principle should apply to fumigation as carpet cleaning, but the commissioner took a different view. \"While I understand they seem similar in nature, carpet cleaning is predominantly cosmetic and the requirement can be determined based on outgoing photographs,\" the ruling says. \"Fumigation is considered a necessary measure to return the property to a hygienic state and remove pests, dander and other allergens associated with pets in the premises. \"Therefore, I am satisfied that a requirement for fumigation at the end of a tenancy is reasonable and is not inconsistent with the [Residential Tenancy] Act.\" The Tenants Union said it did not agree entirely with the commissioner's interpretation of the law. \"We think it's a similar issue and that clauses requiring professional fumigation unconditionally are also invalid if they're not required by the condition of the premises,\" Mr Smith said. \"Say if the tenant had a dog that always stayed outside or simply a fish in a fish tank, why is a tick and flea spray required inside the premises?\"",

        "raw_text": "If you work in an office, you may be doing it already. Hot-desking is the norm in workplaces across the country, usually open-plan offices. But our office etiquette doesn't always reflect how normal hot-desking and open-plan offices have become, according to Natsha Hawker, the managing director of a human resources and recruitment service on Gadigal land in Sydney. Paula Brough is an organisational psychology professor at Griffith University in Brisbane/Meanjin and says hot-desking has been increasing across all sectors since the COVID-19 pandemic. Paula Brough says hot-desking can take some adjustment for workers.(Supplied: Paula Brough) Professor Brough says hot-desking evolved from the popularity of open-plan offices. She says it's \"highly beneficial\" for employers, allowing them to continue supporting some working from home, while saving money on office space and equipment. According to Ms Hawker, \"many businesses are looking for ways to reduce; reduce expenditure and reduce the office footprint\". Ms Hawker says from personal experience, hot-desking comes with \"the benefit of learning by osmosis\". She says she has previously learnt a lot from the different people she has sat next to and the way they work. Professor Brough says how well people handle hot-desking will depend on their personality traits. She says a busy office of rotating desks is more likely to work for someone who is chatty and extroverted, and collaborative discussions in this type of environment could also help generate ideas and stimulate creativity. Emeline Gaske says hot-desking can strip away the \"stability and routine that people need to do their jobs well\".(Supplied: Australian Services Union) \"But you have to be the right person to fit that environment,\" she says. \"People tend to be productive when they feel comfortable\". In offices with a hot-desking policy, the organisation is ideally making the environment more comfortable in other ways. The Australian Services Union's National Secretary Emeline Gaske says hot-desking cuts costs at the expense of workers' morale and productivity. She says the union is seeing a \"real tension between employers pushing hot-desking and workers' desire for flexibility and consistency\". \"It strips away the stability and routine that people need to do their jobs well.\" How do you make hot-desking work for you? Emaileveryday@abc.net.au. How do you make hot-desking work for you? Emaileveryday@abc.net.au. Ms Hawker recommends introducing yourself to the people sitting around you in the first 30 minutes of being at a new desk. \"If you're popping out for a coffee, ask anyone if they want one,\" she suggests. Noise can be a common source of office tension, so Ms Hawker suggests \"keeping personal calls and noise levels to a minimum\". Employers should also have cleaning products and hand sanitiser ready to access for staff rotating between desks, she says. Ms Hawker says employers should ideally also provide personal lockers so desks are left uncluttered at the end of the day. Natasha Hawker is the managing director of an HR and recruitment organisation.(Supplied) Professor Brough and Ms Hawker both point out that regardless of workplace policies, people are \"naturally territorial\" and \"creatures of habit\". Professor Brough says if the desk someone normally sit at is taken, that may \"cause a little bit of internal disruption to people\". However, organisations usually have a clear set of rules around hot-desking, such as no desk-claiming and no leaving belongings behind. Ms Hawker says, \"people gravitate towards the same desk every day; if that desk is already taken it can really put them off and sometimes generate friction\". Experts explain what's reasonable when it comes to a workplace dress code. She says you would need to be in the office a minimum of four days to feel able to claim a desk, because most people who work partly from home are in the office for three days. \"Some employers are adopting a policy of '[if] you're in the office four days a week, then you can claim a desk as a reward.'\" She recommends speaking with someone directly and discreetly if you have an issue. If you are uncomfortable doing that or it's not possible, Ms Hawker suggests speaking with your manager \u2014 and possibly human resources.",

        "raw_text": "I always thought that by my mid-20s, I'd have a life like Monica Geller from Friends, living in a cosy apartment in Sydney's bustling CBD. But life had other plans. I suppose that's the beauty of being young and naive; when you're in your early 20s, you believe life will turn out just as you imagine, even when reality suggests otherwise. For me, reality was loud and clear: \"You can't afford to rent, and you're not eligible for a large mortgage loan.\" Nothing highlighted my inability to access the housing market more than my employment status. Despite being among the minority of people with disabilities who were gainfully employed, my earnings were rarely sufficient. I drifted between two worlds: living at home with stability but limited independence, and subletting a room and sacrificing personal space. Attempts to improve my financial situation were often met with silence from potential employers, who seemed to see my disability before they saw my qualifications. Being locked out of the housing market forces you to rethink your options and face an uncomfortable truth: the dream of home ownership might always remain just that, a dream. For me, this was a problem that needed to be solved. The process of buying the land was an unfamiliar one, which made me anxious, but once it was complete, there was space for possibilities.(Shauna Foley) Growing up as a first-generation Australian with a disability, thousands of kilometres away from my extended family, I often worried about the lack of support for me beyond my mother and sister. With no inheritance or 'bank of mum and dad' to rely on, securing my future wasn't just a goal, it was a necessity. A TV show called Building Off Grid \u2014 about people who have chosen a less travelled path to home ownership \u2014 opened my eyes to the freedom I have to choose my own path. I had a light-bulb moment; why not buy 1,000 to 2,000 square metres of land and build a place of my own? I set a maximum budget of $20,000, a figure that made my friends and family think I was bluffing. However, it was an amount that my savings could easily cover and I would be mortgage free. My criteria was simple: the land had to be within five hours of a capital city, surrounded by nature and mountains, classified as residential or agricultural land, and have access to water, electricity, and plumbing. It also needed to be accessible by a public road. When Rio started building a tiny house during COVID lockdown, moving 3,000 kilometres across the continent wasn't on the cards. Finding a block of land that met all my requirements was easier said than done. Perth was out of the question. The Northern Territory and Queensland felt too remote, and land in New South Wales was either overpriced or had building restrictions that meant it was suitable only for camping. Then in April 2023, I found the perfect block in a small country town called Carrieton, located on Nukunu land in South Australia. Four hours from Adelaide and one hour from Port Augusta, the land cost only $10,000 \u2014 well within my budget. As soon as I saw the online listing for the 1000sqm land, I was sold. I decided I didn't need to see it in person and jumped. The tiny town of Carrieton in South Australia is an hour from Port Augusta and south of the Flinders Ranges.(Supplied: Tim Froling outbackexposures.com.au) Once I took the plunge, the actual process of purchasing the block became a daunting experience that I was completely unprepared for. The entire transaction took place online, which made me anxious. I was dealing with people in a different state, meaning different regulations, and for the first time in my life, I was making an adult purchase that would change the trajectory of my life. This was nothing like spending $50 at a restaurant or on a dress to treat myself. I constantly questioned my judgement: Have I lost my mind? What am I doing? Am I being serious, or just hopelessly naive? Is this a scam? That self-doubt lingered, but I pushed forward, driven by the promise of freedom. When my friends and family found out I had purchased the land, they were stunned and I was suddenly flooded with questions like \"What are you going to build?\" and \"How will you make it work?\" Their curiosity was both validating and intimidating, underscoring the enormity of what I had committed to. Had I bitten off more than I could chew? Absolutely! Buying land in the middle of nowhere comes with significant challenges, especially when the goal is to live there full-time or turn it into a short-term rental. These are challenges I have yet to work out. Logistics such as building permits, designs, arranging shipments and funds, and accessing basic amenities are all ahead of me. The relative isolation of a small town doesn't worry me. And owning my own land in Carrieton is a declaration of freedom.(Supplied: Tim Froling outbackexposures.com.au) But the benefits of owning something are undeniable; I've created a foundation for myself, a safety net that offers both stability and independence. I've been able to shift my focus from worrying about my future to imagining the possibilities ahead. Owning this land is my declaration of freedom. Am I worried about being isolated? Not at all. Living with a disability and being excluded from society teaches you a tough lesson: if you let isolation define you, you'll always be treading water, barely keeping your head above the surface. It comes down to a choice: keep begging for a seat at the table, or make your own rules.

We spoke to four people about the different ways they handle chore splitting in their home. Claire Jensen, 38, Townsville/Gurrumbilbarra, married with three teenagers How do you split the household chores? I have a lot of health issues and work long hours through the week. My husband Chris cooks every night and does a lot of the cleaning through the week. He also helps with organising our children's support workers and appointments. I know my husband is not the norm though. I do all the clothes washing on the weekends, and any other jobs that have been missed through the week. On school holidays I do deep cleaning of some areas. How we manage the chores has evolved over time due to my decline in health. What would you like to change, if anything? I think we have a system that works for us most of the time. How are chores divided in your household? We'd love to hear more perspectives:lifestyle@abc.net.au Gray says one housemate is in charge of mowing the lawns.(Pexels) Gray, 38, Brisbane/Meanjin. Lives in a share house with their partner and teenage son, and three other adults How do you split the household chores? We have myself, my partner and my teenage kid living on the top level and three adults on the bottom level. Each level has a bathroom, but we share the only kitchen upstairs and office space, and have a shared laundry downstairs. We take care of the main upstairs and the other three do downstairs. We have one housemate who does the lawn. He enjoys doing it. Some of us are more proactive than others. I tend to not be great at tidying and leave things like paperwork and clothes on surfaces and chairs, but I do a lot of the deep cleans. The dishes stay under control since I purchased a sliding dirty/clean magnet for the dishwasher. My teenager keeps his room clean, does his bedding, and washes his clothes. My partner and I tend to try and split the cleaning but depending on how stressed we are sometimes that falls harder on one person. Our spreadsheet to divide the mental load worked for more than a year, until significant life changes led us to take a different approach. What would you like to change about the arrangement, if anything? I'd probably get my teenager to pitch in more. He has always kept his room spotless and has been doing his own washing since he was about seven. That seemed so great for his age, I think I just never pushed him harder to help more. I'd love a regimented cleaning schedule for us to stick to. It would help me, too. Samantha and Dusko's 14-year-old daughter helps with the housework.(Supplied) Samantha Popovski, 39, Brisbane/Meanjin, married with one teenager How do you split the household chores? My husband Dusko is in charge of the outside \u2014 maintain the pool, mowing lawns, putting the bins out. He is also the \"finance minister\" of the house, as he calls himself. I used to be in charge of paying bills, but always forgot to do it. I'm in charge of the inside \u2014 cooking, washing, shopping. Things like floors, dishes, and the bathroom are alternated. We do most of our cleaning before guests come over, so split things that need doing. Our 14-year-old daughter is responsible for unloading the dishwasher and helps with washing. She vacuums and cooks about once a week. Weaponised incompetence in relationships can keep women \"locked into\" traditional roles, experts say. What would you like to change, if anything? I'm pretty happy with the way it is mostly, but I do feel like the coordinator of it all and have to ask Dusko to do things sometimes. I also have trouble giving up control of certain things because I don't trust anyone to do it the way I like. I'm trying to be better at letting go. When I'm away they both seem to survive. Kylie Bartlett says she is proud her kids have grown up watching mum and dad share chores.(Supplied) Kylie Bartlett, 48, Sunshine Coast, married with four children, two teens living at home How do you split the household chores? We share everything. If something needs doing, one of us will get it done. If anything, my husband Sean does more than me. He's the one that cooks dinner every night and does the groceries, and does all the gross chores, like cleaning the toilets and bathrooms. I do most of the laundry because I have a system and I enjoy it. I make the bed because I like the way I do it better. I love a good spring clean. Our kids have always had chores to do and so everyone does something whether it's the dishwasher or feeding the animal \u2014 we all just get on with it. We are proud that our kids have grown up seeing both mum and dad doing the chores and that chores are a part of life. While they're not that fun, they still need doing. When the kids were younger, I felt a huge pressure from society to be that super woman/wife/mum so I'd be prepping meals for the week. I was the main cook, I did the bulk of the care giving, bath times, bedtimes, and housekeeping as a stay-at-home mum. Then over the past 10 or so years I've had injuries, and then cancer, which made it impossible for me to do much at all. Sean had to step right up and take on my roles. What would you like to change about the arrangement, if anything? The only thing I want to work on now that I'm healthy again is getting back into cooking. I love cooking. I'd like to try reclaim my love for it, and also my recipes that Sean has used over the years\u2026 and dare I say improved. But the rest of the chores he can keep, if he wants.",

        "raw_text": "Have you ever looked at your cafe bill on a weekend and wondered why your coffee is more expensive than it was midweek? Many of us will have paid Sunday and public holiday surcharges before, but they're becoming more common on your average weekend. Extra charges can be frustrating \u2014 especially if there's no clear explanation around them or the service doesn't stack up. We asked industry experts why businesses are using surcharges more frequently, and how they are calculated. Under consumer law, businesses areallowed to impose a surcharge if they're facing elevated costs on that particular day. Sean Edwards, managing director of Cafe Culture Magazine, points out that costs have gone up in many areas of the hospitality sector. If a business is facing elevated costs on a particular day, they can impose a surcharge.(ABC Lifestyle: Jo Joyce) \"We've seen everything go up, from wage costs to superannuation to workers compensation, which adds \u2026 nearly 20 to 30 per cent on top of the payroll,\" says Mr Edwards, based at Port Macquarie/Birpai land on the New South Wales Mid-North Coast. \"Then things like electricity have gone up, [wholesale] coffee's tripled in price over the last 12 months. Chris Tate is the operations manager of a coffee-roasting business in North Ryde, New South Wales, on the traditional lands of the Wallumedegal people. He sayswages often equate to 35 to 40 per centof total costs and those costs spike on weekends due to penalty rates. \"The surcharge is how venues can honour those award wages without cutting hours, lowering quality, or closing on weekends,\" he says. \"It's a direct link between customers wanting a weekend coffee and making sure the person behind the machine is paid properly.\" Weekend surcharges aren't about boosting profits, they're helping cafes survive, Mr Tate says. \"There's no strict percentage cap on weekend surcharges,\" he explains, butcustomers shouldn't be surprised when they go to pay. He adds that charging fairly and communicating that to customers is key. Cafe operations manager Chris Tate says wages are one of the biggest costs for venues.(Supplied) While state or territory regulations on the way surcharges must be displayed may differ slightly, under Australian Consumer Law, businesses must: That means displaying it onprinted menus, digital ordering pages, or signageand making sure it'seasy to read. \"Anything misleading could breach ACCC (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission) guidelines,\" says Mr Tate, \"so clarity is key\". \"Most customers are understanding when you communicate openly and respectfully.\" Mr Edwards believes it would be rare that a cafe is price gouging. Industry insiders say coffee lovers \u2014 even in regional Australia \u2014 are unlikely to escape paying more for their flat whites. \"I think at the moment everyone's in a tight spot,\" he says. \"There's a lot of real costs, and I think people have just got to relate it back to their own lifestyle and their own house and the cost they're feeling as well. Mr Tate saysthe surcharge only works when it's paired with a great experience. \"If a customer is paying a little more \u2026 they should get more in return such as better service, delicious coffee, and a warm, welcoming atmosphere.\" Customers who believe they've been hit with undisclosed surcharges can make a complaint with theirlocal fair trading or consumer affairs agency.",

        "raw_text": "A garden gnome that disappeared from a popular tourist attraction in Western Australia's south-west has been found, but not without a classic true-crime twist to the mystery. Gnobby the gnome took pride of place at Gnomesville, in the Ferguson Valley, 176 kilometres south of Perth, last Sunday week, a day after triple j's One Night Standmusic festival in Busselton. But a triple j listener reported him missing less than 24 hours later. The 30-centimetre nude figure was signed by acts featured at the festival, including Blusher, Fool Nelson and Spacey Jane. Gnomesville is home to thousands of the small, but perfectly formed figures.(ABC South West WA: Pip Waller) Gnobby's disappearance created national interest, with many people gathering in Gnomesville to joining the gnomehunt. A nearby winery even offered a free lunch to Gnobby's rescuer. Ferguson Valley marketing manager Ebony Harding said many of the hundreds of visitors Gnomesville gets almost daily were keen to help. \"The community really got behind the story and wanted to help find Gnobby,\" Ms Harding said. 'You could see people milling around specific sections looking for him. \"There's no CCTV here, so no-one is keeping an eye on the gnomes, so they do go missing.\" Ebony Harding is grateful the local community rallied to help find Gnobby.(ABC South West WA: Pip Waller) When triple j reported Gnobby had vanished, feared gnomenapped and possibly meeting his end in concrete boots, Perth woman Michelle Kennedy contacted the station to reveal the guilty party: Herself. Admitting she had moved him, the full story came tumbling out. After attending One Night Stand, Ms Kennedy said she drove to Gnomesville to drop off her gnome \"Budsta Move\", but with a thought she couldn't shake. \"I was on a mission to find Gnobby. I arrived at Gnomesville at 2.20pm and I found him at 3.50pm,\" Ms Kenney said. \"And he was exposed under the tree and he had new tattoos on him and I thought, it's going to get really wet soon, he's going to get really cold, his tattoos will wash off. \"So I decided that I'd walk him down to the shed.\" Gnobby was moved into a small shed about 100 metres away from his original resting place.(ABC South West WA: Pip Waller) Ms Kennedy moved Gnobby about 100 metres to a gnome-sized shed. \"It was like a triple j trophy and it was an honour to take Gnobby there [to the shed],\" Ms Kennedy said. \"I did feel a sense of, oh no, maybe I shouldn't have moved him. \"And then I heard on the radio that someone had stolen Gnobby and I was mortified, so I messaged triple j and said, 'I know where he is.'\" She said it was all in \"good fun\" and she had no idea moving Gnobby would cause such a stir.",

        "raw_text": "In 1971, John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono swapped their Ascot mansion and 70-acre estate for a two-room loft in New York's Greenwich Village. They threw themselves headfirst into the political and social movements of the time, helping the counterculture pick up the pieces after what Lennon perceived as the failure of the 'Flower Power' movement in the years prior. It was a significant move for arguably the most famous singer of all time. Lennon turned his back on what could have been an enviable life as part of high society and instead invested his energy and money in ensuring the youth of America didn't become apathetic in the quest for non-violence and equality. \"I'm happy as Larry,\" Lennon said at the time. \"I feel like a student again. We're like a young married couple.\" The only full concert John Lennon played after the break-up of The Beatles is a key part of this new documentary about his life with Yoko Ono in the early 1970s.(Supplied: Sydney Film Festival) One To One: John and Yoko is a fascinating, fast-paced collage of old footage and taped phone conversations that take us inside the couples' movements at this time. The phone calls are particularly compelling as we hear the couple scheming, cycling through a variety of causes, seemingly aching for places they can lend their celebrity clout to raise awareness. There are a few recurring narratives throughout that keep us engrossed. One of them involves capturing thousands of live flies for a Yoko Ono art exhibit, another sees them convince infamous Bob Dylan stalker A. J. Weberman to back off his target, while there are chilling moments where Lennon \u2014 who was shot dead in 1980 \u2014 ruminates about becoming a target when appearing at key demonstrations. Another through line revolves around the only full-length concert John Lennon gave after The Beatles's split and before his death. The concert, which happened across two sessions at Madison Square Garden in 1972, was a benefit for the children of the Willowbrook School \u2014 an institution caring for children with intellectual disabilities. Footage from the show is great, but even more interesting is learning how the couple arrived at the idea to play the show. Because there are so many individual examples of John and Yoko's activism, it makes for a fast-paced video diary with a frenetic energy that perhaps speaks to the couple's own chaotic momentum. \"I thought: There's enough here that we could just let them speak for themselves, allow the audience to eavesdrop on them and allow that to be part of the fun of the film,\" director Kevin Macdonald said in publicity materials around the film. \"I think that's much more interesting than a traditional biopic, where the filmmakers are trying to present a very coherent version of things. As we all know, life is chaotic and contradictory.\" Even if your interest in John and Yoko themselves is negligible, the film will still offer a captivating snapshot of the social and political climate of the time. Whether it's Carole Feraci'sprotest against Richard Nixon, therailing against inhumane conditionsat Attica State prison, or the case of poet John Sinclair, who wasjailed for 10 years for cannabis possession, the film covers plenty of historical moments that paint a riveting picture of the counterculture of the time. And people with a love for old New York City will revel in the way the film plops us right in that space and time. The treatment of Yoko Ono by Lennon's adoring fans and even his Beatles band mates is laid bare in some confronting conversations, where the artist bluntly recounts the comments and violence she'd been subjected to. Speaking of violence, Lennon's past behaviours are only vaguely hinted at. The takeaway message is that the John Lennon of the early 70s was a more enlightened man than the one who grew up scrapping in Liverpool and was violent towards his first wife, Cynthia, in the 1960s. \"I fell in love with an independent, eloquent, outspoken, creative genius,\" Lennon says at one point. \"I started waking up.\" While there may be a touch of hagiography about One To One, it's a rare example of a John Lennon documentary that offers something many fans might not have seen or even known about before. As far as history lessons go, it's totally compelling. As we learned in the eight-hour 2021 documentary Get Back, which took us inside the recording of The Beatles's final album, being a fly on the wall for historical moments is a captivating prospect. This film moves far quicker, but the same idea applies: we're always shown what John and Yoko do rather than merely told about it. \"Very early on, I decided I wasn\u2019t going to try and chase old men on their deathbeds to get their last John Lennon anecdote \u2014 which they've probably told before,\" director Macdonald said. One To One: John & Yoko is a truly intimate capture of what drove this couple at a key point in their life, and how their very presence at this key moment had an impact on the countercultural movement of the time. One To One: John & Yoko screens at the Sydney Film Festival this weekend.",

        "raw_text": "With so many Australians doing big things in K-pop, a key question is why. How is it that Australia has produced so many homegrown K-pop stars? This is something Roald Maliangkay from the Australian National University has pondered. Roald Maliangkay is the Deputy Director of the Korea Institute at the Australian National University (ANU).(Supplied) And yes, he is named after the late decorated British children's author Roald Dahl. Professor Maliangkay specialises in popular culture in East Asia and has researched the South Korean entertainment industry throughout the 20thcentury up to the present day. He's come up with a few reasons why Australia is fertile ground for producing K-pop stars. \"I think one important reason is that a lot of the Korean Australians here speak Korean, maybe not well, but they are fairly recent migrants,\" Professor Maliangkay said. \"It's usually their parents who migrate to Australia and that means that their parents will speak Korean at home. \"I think that's one important reason so that makes it very likely for the trainees, which they are at first, to at least be familiar with the sounds so they can pick up Korean quite easily even if they didn't always speak Korean at home or outside in public. \"So, I think the language aspect is quite significant.\" Professor Maliangkay says demographics plays a part. \"Of course, we are a very small country in terms of population but if you look at cities like Sydney and Melbourne then the concentration of Asians around you will be much greater which probably provides a bit of an impetus for young people to try and establish their own identity and be noticed. \"And I think that is another driver for young Australians with an Asian background to perhaps try their luck at becoming a K-pop artist.\" \"Another factor is that communication amongst Australians tends to be rather positive,\" Professor Maliangkay said. \"People here communicate in a very positive manner. \"Australians are really good at representing themselves and in engaging in conversation so that also makes things easy for an agency. \"Australians are generally very polite, they're pleasant and they use a lot of words like fantastic, wonderful and great, which when you go to Britain that is not exactly the case.\" Professor Maliangkay says it's unlikely there are political reasons at play, but it could be a tiny factor. \"I don't think it is very likely that it's a political decision not to go with a United States-born artist,\" he said. \"But I do think that it's a little easier for Chinese fans to fall in love with a non-US based idol than it is when you're dealing with someone born in Australia. \"It's a tiny factor and the fans ultimately will fall in love anyway, but I think it might make things just a little easier.\" \"If you're a young person and you want to go to a workshop in Korea and try your luck at an audition, at the moment, the time difference between us and Seoul is one hour only,\" Professor Maliangkay said. \"So, that makes going back-and-forth even when you're in high school just a little easier. \"Again, that's a tiny reason just like the political one but the other reasons I'm more sure of, that is, the language aspect, the greater convergence of Asian Australians and then the communication and the representation of Australians in general.\" So, who has made it big and who is on their way? Blackpink's Ros\u00e9 made history when her collaboration with Bruno Mars APT debuted at number one on the ARIA singles chart making her the first solo female K-pop star to top the ARIA chart. \"She was born in New Zealand but then she was raised in Melbourne, I think from the age of seven and then she trained herself singing in church choirs,\" says Professor Maliangkay. \"She just suddenly had the courage when she was quite young, I think she was 16, to pack her bags and go to YG entertainment where she went to train, and it worked out. \"In the beginning, she was an absolute nobody, of course, and risked a lot doing all this and spending money on this. NewJeans broke a Guinness World Record when they became the fastest K-pop act to reach a billion streams on Spotify, unseating BTS. They have two Australian members. \"Danielle was born outside a big city, in Newcastle, NSW,\" Professor Maliangkay said. Danielle from NewJeans was born in Newcastle, NSW.(Supplied: Courtesy of ADOR) \"She has an Australian father and a Korean mother. \"And they moved to Korea in 2019 at around the age of 14. \"She was kind of scouted by HYBE.\" Hanni was born in Melbourne to Vietnamese parents. Hanni from NewJeans was born in Melbourne.(Supplied: Courtesy of ADOR) \"[She] moved to Seoul around 2020 at the age of 16 so that would make her 21 right now. \"She also ended up with the same company, with HYBE.\" Fans of K-pop would be aware of some recent news surrounding the multinational entertainment company HYBE. \"Although the company has responded to the recent allegations of insider trading by a former executive saying it is fully cooperating with the authorities, it denies any wrongdoing by chairman Bang Si-hyuk. \"And yet, since December, Bang has been under police investigation on suspicion of profiting by as much as $450 million from misleading shareholders during the company's listing.\" HYBE has issued the following statement to ABC News on the matter. Regarding NewJeans, Professor Maliangkay says fans were distraught to learn of a stand-off between NewJeans and parent company HYBE. \"What is more, following the public fallout over management rights with former CEO Min Hee-jin of ADOR that began in April last year, NewJeans's activities have now been put on hold, with ADOR last Friday winning an injunction against the group members engaging in any unauthorised individual entertainment activities until the legal process has run its course,\" Professor Maliangkay said. \"The idols stand by Min and argue that HYBE's reorganisation of ADOR has turned it into something very different from the label they signed with. \"Conflicts between idols and their management over contracts are not uncommon. Groups like Fifty Fifty, Loona, and TVXQ have faced serious disputes, some of which have led to their disbandment. \"While the high stakes of investment and intense competition help explain the often inequitable nature of contracts, fans typically rally behind the idols, so the companies almost always stand to lose from public disputes. \"I suspect that quite a few fans will respond to the scandals either by not investing as much money in HYBE products, or embracing the idols of other agencies, or both. \"Despite the negative reports surrounding HYBE's management, however, fans' excitement for BTS's long-awaited return \u2014 marked by SUGA's military discharge on June 21 \u2014 will likely remain undiminished.\" HYBE subsidiary ADOR has issued the following statement. \"We express our sincere gratitude for the court's judicious decision to grant the preliminary injunction. Stray Kids has two Australian members \u2014 Felix (fifth from left) and Bang Chan (third from right, back row).(Supplied: Virgin Music Group) Felix was born and raised in Sydney and Bang Chan was born in Seoul and grew up in Sydney. \"Felix is the fashion icon, partly, of Stray Kids and he's doing really well in that sense in addition to of course being a very talented performer,\" Professor Maliangkay said. \"Bang Chan is also very much a composer. \"He has his own kind of composing agency as well. \"So, he's composed quite a lot of music for Stray Kids. \"He's also the leader of [the group]. \"If I had to pick the top K-pop groups at the moment, NewJeans and Stray Kids would be in that list. \"It's quite something to have both groups having two Australian members so it is significant and that's why I think it's very good to ask indeed why is it? \"Because you do wonder why is it that there are so many Australians [in K-pop].\" NMIXX will be perform in Australia this month with Lily (third from left) returning home for the shows.(Supplied: Virgin Music Group) NMIXX's Lily is returning home this month to perform in Melbourne and Sydney. \"Lily was born in Marysville, Victoria to a Korean mother and an Australian father,\" Professor Maliangkay said. \"About 10 years ago, she left to work for JYP Entertainment. \"She signed a contract in 2015 and eventually then into 2022 she then debuted with NMIXX, which means seven years of training and preparation before you actually end up being a frontline act. \"It's a long time to just be training, it's a bit like doing a PhD.\" \"Jake was born in South Korea but then grew up in Brisbane,\" Professor Maliangkay said. \"He moved back to Seoul in 2019 and then trained under HYBE. Jake from Enhypen grew up in Brisbane.(Supplied: Courtesy of BELIFT LAB) \"Roughly after one year he was made part of Enhypen and I think they're doing quite well. \"Of course, Brisbane also has a very large Asian community, so I suppose there's a little bit of an impetus for young Asian Australians to kind of stand out a little bit and do something different, be noticed, and then of course with all trainees the lure of fame, money, fashion, and perhaps cosmetic surgery, which is definitely one of the perks, because the agencies will help you arrange that.\" Others to watch out for are Robin from n.SSign, who has debuted, and who said on TikTok that he went to the same school as Felix from Stray Kids and cites the whole group as role models. AndMackiah from ampers&one who is from Western Sydney and debuted in 2023.",

        "raw_text": "\"All this saving the world, is it really service, duty, righteous anger, or is it just a childlike desire to be at the centre of the action?\" Bono wonders backstage at his sold-out, one-man show at New York's Beacon Theater in 2023. \"Desire and virtue is a whole dance.\" What:U2 singer Bono lays bare his life and career in a one-man stage show, part spoken-word and part solo music performance. Starring:Bono Director:Andrew Dominik Where:Streaming now on Apple TV+ Likely to make you feel:Like falling in love with U2 again \u2014 if you're a fan Across a 45-year career as a globe-straddling superstar and activist, the U2 singer has danced the fine line between rock 'n' roll icon and enduring public nuisance. He's been both the voice of one of the biggest bands of the late 20th-century and \u2014 to some, at least \u2014 a blowhard palling around with celebrities and world leaders. But as the new movie Bono: Stories of Surrender shows, there's a complicated, endearingly contradictory man behind the often-outsized public profile; one whose idealism is frequently troubled by self-doubt, and whose pursuit of stardom stems from a past steeped in loss. Filmed over several nights of his New York residency, Stories of Surrender vividly captures Bono's one-man adaptation of his best-selling 2022 memoir, Surrender, translating the book's revealing candour to the stage with the singer's typically self-reflexive humour. As he quipped to Jimmy Kimmel recently: \"I play an aging rock star on a massive ego trip.\" There are no mirror-balls or giant lemons or jumbotrons broadcasting prank calls to The White House, just a starkly lit stage and a few empty pieces of furniture to stand in for key figures in his life \u2014 including the rest of U2, who are nowhere to be found. During the show, Bono re-creates infrequent pub meetings he used to have with his late father.(Supplied: Apple TV+) It begins, as many such stories do, with a health scare that prompts a crisis of faith and life evaluation. \"How did I get here?\" Bono asks, echoing the words of his contemporary David Byrne, after an operation on his \"eccentric\" heart in 2016. Still, it's hardly a sombre opening: the star is in full-tilt carnival-barker mode, part preacher, part game-show host, a pair of wraparound shades short of his Zoo TV MacPhisto. Bono's brand of ironic bravado, in which every sincere moment is inevitably chased by a self-deprecating shot, will do little to convince detractors who regard him as the epitome of anti-cool. For U2 fans, however, it's a wonderful reminder of just how adept he is with a pithy turn of phrase or ready-made pop graffiti \u2014 he's perhaps the only songwriter to land the line \"you're turning tricks with your crucifix\" on a major motion picture soundtrack aimed at children. Bono still manages to draw power and emotion from his aging voice.(Supplied: Apple TV+) Much of Bono's humour appears to originate from his late father, Bob Hewson, a man who looms over the show despite appearing only as an empty chair and a glass of Black Bush whiskey. Playing both father and son, Bono recreates infrequent pub meetings with his Da, who remains hilariously unimpressed with his kid's success (labelling him \"a baritone who thinks he's a tenor\"), nor his phone calls from Pavarotti (Bono's impression of the Italian opera giant is among the film's funniest moments). You Can't Leave U2 Behind... Their relationship was complex. After a 14-year-old Bono lost his mother, who collapsed at his grandfather's funeral (\"It sounds almost too Irish, I know,\" he jokes), his father never spoke of her again. Her death haunted almost every aspect of the rocker's life and career. At the very same time, he would meet his future wife, Ali, and the musicians \u2014 The Edge, Larry Mullen Jr, and Adam Clayton \u2014 with whom he'd rocket to mulleted 80s stardom. The stories of U2's early adventures are invariably charming, as the teenage band fumbles about to land on their signature sound \u2014 at one point Bono urging The Edge to make his guitar \"sound like an electric drill into the ear\". It's Bono's reckoning with fame that proves to be the real revelation, however, as he and his band mates wrestle with their spiritual beliefs in the wake of new-found celebrity. The U2 frontman's brand of ironic bravado will still likely grate with the haters.(Supplied: Apple TV+) \"Fame is currency,\" Bono reasons. \"You wouldn't need charity if the world was just, so \u2014 get the cheque.\" If the humanitarian act borders on Vegas schtick, Bono is the first to admit it. \"I am an over-paid, over-regarded, over-rewarded, over-fed rock 'n' roll star,\" he says in voiceover, commenting on the action. And whenever the self-therapy pauses for a burst of music, it's hard to resist those soaring pipes, still stirring after all these years and audible wear and tear. 'With Or Without You', delivered here in thorny tribute to his wife, remains as sad and gorgeous as ever, while 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' takes on a new, ghostly power in a stripped back, slowed down performance. The movie is littered with stripped-back U2 classics and crowd favourites.(Supplied: Apple TV+) Meanwhile, U2's 1988 hit 'Desire' emerges as both a pivotal point in the band's career and a key text in Bono's life, tapping into the tension between the sacred and the profane that the band would toy with on 90s highlights Achtung Baby and Zooropa. \"For love or money, money, money,\" Bono sings, throwing theatrical shapes and channelling late-period Elvis. Even 'Beautiful Day' \u2014 arguably the beginning of U2's long decline into musical irrelevance \u2014 becomes a moving elegy for the dead, as Bono teases out the melancholy beneath the song's radio-friendly chorus. It's a lovely moment, a tribute to those we've lost and to all the strange little things that somehow keep us going along the way. Haters will burn with renewed fire, but if you've ever had a soft spot for U2, Stories of Surrender may just make you fall in love with them all over again.",

According to Reuters, only Britain has struck a preliminary trade agreement with the U.S. during the 90-day pause. The pause is set to expire in about five weeks, with investors worried about the lack of progress in hashing out deals. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi has said Tokyo has not even received a letter from Washington asking for its best proposals on trade talks. Global economic uncertainty have left investors fleeing U.S. assets and looking for safer alternatives, including gold. If investors continue to flee U.S. assets, then many are asking where the money that usually flowed into U.S. assets will end up going.. \"While Europemay be the obvious destination, relative value metrics may favour emerging Asia,\" says Manishi Raychaudhuri, the founder and CEO of Emmer Capital Partners Ltd. Asian markets rose today, boosted by tech stocks as traders hope a deal could still be possible if and when U.S. President  Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping talk this week. By Adelaide Miller The U.S. tariff rate on most imported steel and aluminum has doubled as President Donald Trump amps up global trade wars. According to Reuters it comes the same day he expects trading partners to deliver their \"best offer\" in bids to avoid punishing import tax rates on other goods. Last week, Trump announced he was taking the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% up to 50%. \"We started at 25 and then after studying the data more, realized that it was a big help, but more help is needed. And so that is why the 50 is starting tomorrow,\" White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said in explaining the move at a steel industry conference in Washington on Tuesday. The increase applies to all trading partners except Britain, the only country so far that has struck a preliminary trade agreement with the U.S. during a 90-day pause on a wider array of Trump tariffs. By Adelaide Miller Market analyst Tony Sycamore says despite Australia's fourteenth consecutive quarter of economic growth, today's GDP results reaffirm the \"economy continues to muddle along at a rate significantly below the 2.5%-3% growth rate we grew accustomed to before the COVID shock\". \"It also suggests the economy will fall short of the RBA\u2019s recently revised lower forecasts of 1.8% for June 2025 and 2.1% for December 2025.\" Mr Sycamore says the slow growth reinforces the case for the RBA to continue easing its restrictive monetary policy settings. \"We expect the RBA to cut rates by 25 basis points at its meeting in July, bringing it to 3.60%, and to deliver another 25 basis point cut in August.\" By Adelaide Miller Soft business investment growth indicates an ongoing lack of spark in private sector activity, according toStephen Smith, partner at Deloitte Access Economics. He says it is important to ensure policy settings are optimised now for future economic growth. \"With Parliament not resuming until late July, policymakers and legislators should be thinking about how to hit the ground running to execute a policy agenda that prioritises lifting productivity and economic growth in a sustainable way that does not reignite inflation,\" he says. But he says the private sector must also step up. \"Business also has to be willing to reignite its sense of entrepreneurialism and innovation to invest in state-of-the-art technology, skills, and new markets.\" By Adelaide Miller According to RSM Australia Economist Devika Shivadekar, today's GDP results reflect an economy that has been heavily disrupted both locally and nationally. \u201cThese disruptions not only impacted household consumption and business investment but also contributed to a sharp detraction in public spending\u2014the largest since 2017\u2014and a hit to exports across key sectors like mining, tourism, and shipping,\" she said. Despite household spending increasing by 0.4%, Ms Shivadekar said \"this was driven largely by non-discretionary items such as food, rent, and energy costs\". \"On a per capita basis, GDP slipped 0.2%, and while the household saving ratio rose to 5.2%, thanks to higher incomes and emergency support\u2014highlighting the cautious stance households are still taking.\" Ms Shivadekar said today's results mean the Reserve Bank of Australia will remain \"cautious\", with the next interest rate cut expected in August. \u201cOngoing global uncertainty, muted household spending, and the aftershocks of recent climate-related disruptions all contribute to a more dovish near-term stance.\" She said the latest business indicators data revealed Australian businesses were in trouble: \u201cManufacturing is stuck in a deep rut with sales down for the fifth straight quarter, pointing to longer-term structural problems rather than a short-term dip. \u201cMining profits are under pressure as global commodity prices soften and inventories swell, while retailers are also feeling the pinch with consumer hesitancy seeing them resort to heavier discounting to clear stock. \u201cConstruction activity is also cooling despite population-driven demand for housing, with rising costs and persistent labour shortages acting as constraints.\" However, she said professional services are growing especially in fields tied to energy transition and artificial intelligence. \u201cThe picture is clear \u2014 Australia\u2019s economy is moving through a period of transition and there is a clear need to maintain the balance by providing targeted support to industries under strain, while supporting the momentum in sectors at the forefront of change.\u201d By Emily Stewart Consumers are prioritising rebuilding their savings rather than spending, says Westpac senior economist Pat Bustamante. The saving-to-income ratio increased to 5.2% from 3.9% in the December quarter. You can see the full chat with finance presenter Alicia Barry here: By Emily Stewart Is a slowing GDP good news for our market ? It seems so. - Craig Hi Craig, Thanks for your question. Interestingly, the markets barely moved when the GDP results were dropped (despite the tepid growth). I've been watching the local markets on my screen and they have been steadily climbing since the open. Investors seem to be more influenced by the US trade talks and higher oil prices at this stage. And now the market is within 0.4% off its best ever close. Interesting! By Emily Stewart Local markets are having a solid day, hitting a new 50-day high. The ASX 200 is up almost 0.8 per cent in the middle of the trading day, to 8,532 points (at 12:40pm AEST). The broader All Ordinaries index is up 0.8 per cent to 8,759 points. Nine of the eleven sectors are higher, with just technology and consumer non-cyclicals in the red. Markets were largely unchanged after the GDP results were released and the dollar fell just 0.1%. Zip Co and Lovisa Holdings are the top performing individual stocks up almost 11% and 8% respectively. Lovisa is up on the news Mark McInnes has been appointed as the Deputy Chairman. Nufarm is leading the worst-performing stocks, down -2.9%. By Emily Stewart The Transport Workers' Union wants clarity on what the public float will mean for workers. Virgin Australia has announced a $685 million initial public offering, at $2.90 a share. It will reduce Bain Capital's stake from 70% to around 40%, while Qatar Airways will retain a 23% stake. The union's national assistant secretary Emily McMillan says the airline was on the brink of devastation and is now back to making record profits, with workers making this result possible. \"There are still question marks around this public float as well as Qatar's stake in the airline, and what this means for workers,\" she said. \"While an IPO has the potential to further grow the airline and increase opportunities for workers and the travelling public, we must see Virgin make clear that it will continue to consult closely with its workforce.\" Virgin announced this week that employees would receive $3000 worth of share rights as part of the IPO. By Emily Stewart Economists say the RBA may cut rates again in July after economic growth was weaker than expected. Australia's GDP rose just 0.2% in the March quarter, down from 0.6% in the December quarter. Ben Udy, lead economist for Oxford Economics Australia, said: \"Looking ahead, the increase in global uncertainty was only just getting warmed up in Q1. \"While it's still too soon to know for sure, early signs point to an even larger drag from confidence on consumption and investment in Q1.\" He says the RBA will be watching closely for further signs that the weakness in the March quarter extends into the June quarter. \"If that evidence continues to rack up, the RBA may opt to cut rates again in July, a little sooner than our current forecasts suggest.\" The Reserve Bank had forecast annual GDP growth of 1.8% by the end of the June quarter. The economy has grown 1.3% for the year to March. By Emily Stewart GDP growth was hampered by reduced public sector spending as well as extreme weather events, according to the ABS. \"Extreme weather events reduced domestic final demand and exports. Weather impacts were particularly evident in mining, tourism and shipping,\" Katherine Keenan, ABS head of national accounts, said. There was no growth in government final consumption expenditure in the March quarter, as state and local governments spent less on social benefits to households for energy bill relief. Housing spending was up 0.4%, driven by essentials such as food and rent. \"Growth was relatively slow across most household spending categories following stronger than usual spending during December quarter's retail sales events,\" Ms Keenan said. Australian households saved more, with the saving-to-income ratio increasing to 5.2% from 3.9% in the December quarter. \"The 1.3 percentage points rise in the household savings ratio this quarter included higher income support from government and insurance claims linked to severe weather events in Queensland,\" she said. \"There was also a small rise in small business income, while mortgage interest payments dropped following the Reserve Bank of Australia cash rate in February 2025.\" Private investment rose 0.7% in the March quarter, led by investment in dwellings, new buildings and new engineering construction. In its latest economic statement, the Reserve Bank had forecast annual GDP growth of 1.8% by the end of the June quarter. The economy will need to grow noticeably in the June quarter to meet that target. By Emily Stewart Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) rose 0.2% in the March quarter. The Australian Bureau of Statics figures show the economy grew 1.3% in the year to March. Katherine Keenan, ABS head of national accounts, said: \"Economic growth was soft in the March quarter. \"Public spending recorded the largest detraction from growth since the September quarter 2017.\" By Emily Stewart SUVs continue to be the most popular vehicle in the Australian market, according to monthly figures released by the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries. More than 105,000 vehicles were sold in May, up from almost 91,000 in April, but that's down on the same time last year. \"While down 5.2% compared to the same month in 2024, the results reflect a market that remains resilient and competitive by historic standards. The fundamentals of the market remain robust, with strong competition and consumer interest across range of vehicle types,\" said the chamber's CEO Tony Weber. In the year to May, SUVs grew to 60% of all new vehicles sold in Australia, compared to 56% in 2024. The biggest-selling brand was Toyota (with almost 24,000 sales in May), followed by Ford (8,500 sales) and Mazda (7,800 sales). By Emily Stewart Donald Trump's tariffs will contribute to a weaker outlook for Australia's economy, a Reserve Bank official says. Assistant governor Sarah Hunter said Australia was unlikely to face direct negative impacts. But the uncertainty sparked by the tariffs would hurt our economy in indirect ways. She explained why the RBA revised its official forecasts recently to anticipate weaker growth, lower inflation and a slightly higher unemployment rate over the next 12 months. \"Global uncertainty may weigh substantially on domestic activity if uncertainty remains elevated,\" she warned. The latest quarterly GDP figures will be released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics at 11.30am AEST.

        "raw_text": "Australia's economy grew by 0.2 per cent in the March quarter, and 1.3 per cent through the year, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). It means quarterly economic growth slowed in the first three months of the year, from 0.6 per cent at the end of 2024, and missed expectations. \"Public spending recorded the largest detraction from growth since the September quarter 2017,\" said ABS head of national accounts Katherine Keenan. \"Extreme weather events reduced domestic final demand and exports. Weather impacts were particularly evident in mining, tourism and shipping,\" she said. The RBA was too slow to lift rates, and it didn't want to make the same mistake when cutting them, the central bank's governor has told a parliamentary committee. That lower than expected growth in the March quarter means the economy's annual growth rate \u2014 1.3 per cent \u2014 has remained the same for the last six months (on a through-the-year basis). In its latest economic statement, the Reserve Bank forecast annual GDP growth of 1.8 per cent by the end of the June quarter, picking up to 2.1 per cent by the end of this year \u2014 adowngrade to its previous forecastsfollowing the Trump administration's shock tariff announcement in April. It means the economy will have to grow noticeably in the June quarter to meet that annual target. \"Australia's economy continued to limp ahead in the first months of this year,\" said David Bassanese, BetaShares chief economist. \"Although special factors help to account for some of the softness in GDP \u2014 such as cyclones, heavy rainfall and flooding along parts of the east coast \u2014 it's also the case that underlying consumer spending and business investment remains relatively subdued. \"This likely reflects the ongoing squeeze on some households from restrictive interest rate levels along with some caution in the face of US President Trump's tariff war and associated financial market volatility,\" he said. The public sector detracted from growth in the March quarter (-0.1 percentage points), with large declines in public investment and no growth in government spending. Net trade also detracted from growth (-0.1 percentage points) due to reduced exports of goods and services, partly offset by a fall in imports. Private demand drove the growth (+0.3 percentage points), helping to keep GDP growth positive overall, but it was still weaker in the March quarter than in the December quarter. \"In line with our updated expectations, public demand fell and the private sector struggled to pick up the slack,\" Westpac senior economist Pat Bustamante said. \"While one-off factors, mainly related to bad weather events in Queensland and New South Wales, played a role, underlying momentum is undoubtedly weak. \"We have spoken about the possibility of a period of sub-par economic growth if the handover from the public to the private sector is 'shaky'. Assistant governor Sarah Hunter says Australia is unlikely to be directly impacted by Donald Trump's tariffs, but global uncertainty may cause weaker growth and labour market. \"This risk has been exacerbated by global uncertainties relating to US trade policy, which has weighed on confidence and the willingness to invest and spend. There were patches of more positive data. Digging into the private sector data, private investment rose by a decent 0.7 per cent in the March quarter led by investment in dwellings, new buildings and new engineering construction. Dwellings investment surged by 2.6 per cent \u2014 its strongest result in four years. The ABS said investment in both houses and alterations and additions grew in line with recent increases in approvals. Non-dwelling construction investment also grew by a solid 1.7 per cent, although that was largely offset by a 1.7 per cent fall in machinery and equipment investment. The household saving ratio rose to 5.2 per cent in the quarter, up from 3.9 per cent in the December quarter, as growth in gross disposable income outpaced growth in household consumption. The rise in disposable income was driven by 1.5 per cent growth in 'compensation of employees' (wages, salaries, and employers' social contributions), which was partly offset by more income tax payable. The rise in the savings ratio also included higher insurance claims linked to severe weather events in Queensland and New South Wales (cyclone and flood damage), and higher income support from government. Households with mortgages also benefited from lower interest payments following the RBA's cash rate cut in February. Household spending was relatively slow in the March quarter, following stronger than usual spending during the December quarter's retail sales events. But spending on essentials like food and rent continued to be among the highest contributors to household spending growth. But overall, economists say Australia's economy started 2025 in a weak position. GDP per person fell again in the March quarter, by 0.2 per cent, following a meek 0.1 per cent rise in the December 2024 quarter. Australia's population has grown much faster than the economy over the last year. Cherelle Murphy, EY chief economist, says it looks like the economy has \"little energy\" as it faces new threats from geopolitical fractiousness and higher tariffs in the United States. She said more rate cuts were needed. RBA deputy governor Andrew Hauser says he witnessed first-hand China's willingness to fight a US trade war. \"The economy needs much more monetary easing, especially now the threat of inflation is easing and the Trump administration's initial policy impact on the global economy has not even fully shown up in the economic data,\" she said. \"Had the Reserve Bank been able to observe the softness of the economy and the fall in inflation in the March quarter, it is likely the interest rate cutting cycle would have started sooner.\" She said the national accounts showed the economy faced longer-term structural issues too. \"Weak business investment which has been stuck between 11 and 15 per cent of GDP over the last decade suggests tax and regulatory settings are holding back innovation and also probably foreigners\u2019 interest in investing in Australia,\" she said. \"The Productivity Commission's current work on how to boost productivity growth through \"creating a dynamic and resilient economy\" (as well as through other pillars) needs to be adopted with enthusiasm by the Albanese government.\"",

        "raw_text": "Corporate regulator ASIC has sued Westpac's lender RAMS, alleging it engaged in systemic misconduct when arranging home loans. The now-shuttered Westpac-owned brand is facing the court action for failing to properly supervise staff who worked for its franchises. ASIC alleges this led to misconduct including fake pay slips being submitted for mortgage applications, and customers' debts and expenses being altered so they would meet loan serviceability requirements. Home loans based on dodgy documentation or exaggerated claimsare known as \"liar loans\". ASIC has accused RAMS of breaching its obligations under credit laws and engaging in \"widespread unlicensed conduct\" between June 2019 and April 2023. In one instance, ASIC said \"a RAMS franchise employee was found to be involved in manufacturing a fake contract of sale for a home\". Another allegation includes a \"false wages\" case, where fake pay slips for \"non-existent employers\" were submitted and supported by bank statements showing matching payments of those wages. ASIC notes that in some cases, it was difficult to determine which parties \"knew that false documents had been supplied in support of a loan application\". One company that works with lenders to check that loans do not contain dodgy material estimates that about 3 per cent of all applications contain issues. \"Across the industry, this is a real risk that needs to be managed,\" Sean Quagliani, the co-founder of financial technology company Fortiro, told ABC News. This includes somebody \"beefing up\" the income on their payslip by doctoring it, Mr Quagliani said. Sean Quagliani says online tools are making it easier for people to create fake documents.(ABC News: Sean Warren) Yet he said it was difficult to see where the issues were originating. Mr Quagliani said it was suspected \"liar loans\" were a combination of applicants submitting dodgy documents, or even brokers or lenders facilitating fraud. \"It is difficult to say because it does come from everywhere,\" he added. Mr Quagliani\u00a0did not specifically comment on the RAMS case. Westpac announced in August 2024 it would shut the RAMS brand to new home loan applications and absorb its existing loans into the broader group. RAMS operated as a standalone business within Westpac, run by independent franchisees that wrote RAMS-branded home loans backed by Westpac. Under Westpac, RAMS has already admitted liability for the contraventions and remediated almost 50 customers who were negatively affected by the misconduct around $7.5 million. In a statement, Westpac said RAMS would \"continue to work cooperatively with ASIC to resolve the proceedings as quickly as possible\". \"RAMS allowed years of unlawful conduct to occur across its franchises, creating the opportunity for loans to be provided to customers who otherwise may not have qualified for those loans, and thereby increasing commissions earned by RAMS franchisees.\" Some of those RAMS franchisees are now suing Westpac, alleging in a class action that the big bank wrongfully terminated their franchise agreements. In a statement sent from their legal team, the franchisees maintain \"suspected anomalies\" in loan applications were due to \"critical deficiencies\" in Westpac's systems, among other issues. The statement claimed the RAMS franchisees had been left out of the latest ASIC proceedings, and that their class action claims contradicted the case being run by the regulator. ASIC was contacted for additional comment, but declined. Westpac also declined to comment. Westpac closed RAMS to new home loan applications in August 2024 but retained the existing business.(Reuters: Tim Wimborne) The regulator has also alleged that RAMS dealt with unlicensed referrers. The use of referrers to bring in home loan business was highlighted during the banking royal commission,with NAB's since-scrapped \"Introducer\" program coming under fire. ASIC is seeking penalties from the proceedings. The big four bank expects that existing money set aside will be enough to cover any financial hit as a result of the proceedings, however it has not disclosed specifically how much.",

        "raw_text": "Telstra has again fallen short of regulator standards and community expectations in providing access to emergency services. The telco giant has paid a penalty and agreed to launch an independent review after it mistakenly disabled its connection to an emergency call relay service, which is used by people with hearing or speech impairments. In a life- or property-threatening time-critical emergency situation, Australians should contact triple-0 (000) \u2014 or, if they are using a type and listen or teletypewriter (TTY) device, they can dial 106 to be connected to police, fire or ambulance services. An Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) investigation found the 106 emergency call service number was inadvertently made unavailable for 12 hours and 46 minutes between July 5 and 6 2024, following a server migration process. TTY is a text-based communication method for individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing or have speech impairments, allowing them to communicate via typed text over a phone line. A relay officer reads out the text a person types into their TTY device to an emergency operator. ACMA says it takes any disruption to an emergency call service very seriously, given there could be devastating consequences for members of the public. Vodafone accuses Telstra of \"misleading\" consumers over the extent of its mobile coverage resulting in an \"unfair market advantage.\" \"This mistake could have contributed to very serious harm if someone who relies on this service had needed emergency assistance but was unable to get through,\" ACMA member and consumer lead Samantha Yorke said. \"Fortunately, the records show no one attempted to use the 106 service for an emergency during the time the service was disabled.\" Under emergency call service rules, carriers must maintain the proper and effective functioning of their networks and facilities that are used to carry emergency calls. An analyst has raised concerns about the repeated failure of Australia's largest telecommunications providers to meet basic consumer needs. In December 2024,the ACMA imposed a $3 million penalty on Telstraafter an investigation found 473 breaches of emergency call rules when Telstra's triple-0 call centre experienced a disruption for 90 minutes. An investigation found the telecommunications company made 473 breaches during a disruption in March, with Telstra's triple-0 call centre failing to properly transfer calls to emergency services. \"We've now had two major emergency service failures from Telstra in under a year,\" telecommunications consultant Paul Budde said, describing the incidents as \"warning signs that core infrastructure is being compromised\". Telstra has given the ACMA a court-enforceable undertaking to improve its relevant change management processes. It has also engaged an independent reviewer to look at the range of operational arrangements that support reliable delivery of the 106 emergency call service. \"For years, Telstra has tried to position itself as a high-value tech company rather than a reliable utility,\" Mr Budde said. \"But you can't build a shiny digital future on crumbling foundations. Telstra CEO Vicki Brady defends claim the telco provides 3 million square kilometres of coverage without using an external antenna. Telstra has also paid a penalty of $18,780, the maximum the ACMA could impose under the circumstances. Mr Budde said it was \"pocket change\" for the telco. \"We need penalties that actually hurt \u2014 or better yet, incentives that reward doing the right thing.\" Optus was penalised a record $12 million by ACMA in late 2024 for a November 2023 network outagethat caused considerable disruption to emergency call services. Telstra has committed to an independent review of its systems and says it will implement any reasonable recommendations of the review, develop and provide staff training and report regularly to ACMA on its progress implementing these undertakings. In a written statement, a Telstra spokesperson told the ABC that while no emergency calls failed during the disruption on July 6, 2024, the Telco understands the \"critical importance of maintaining reliable emergency call services and the potential consequences of any disruption.\" \u201cWe fully accept the findings of the ACMA and have committed to an independent review of our change management processes and operational arrangements to ensure such a mistake doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d the spokesperson said.",

        "summary": "The amount of uncertainty in the global economy about Donald Trump's tariffs has contributed to a weaker outlook for Australia's economy, a Reserve Bank official says. Assistant governor Sarah Hunter said Australia was unlikely to face direct negative impacts.",
        "raw_text": "Australia's economy will experience weaker growth, lower inflation and a slightly weaker labour market as a consequence of US President Donald Trump's tariffs, an RBA official says. Sarah Hunter, an assistant governor at the Reserve Bank, said the uncertainty caused by Mr Trump's tariffs \u2014 with their constantly shifting rules and levels \u2014 was also making it harder to forecast where the global economy was heading. She said Australia's economy, at this point, probably would not suffer a material direct negative impact from the tariffs. The greatest uncertainty overhanging the global economy is America, once the bedrock of global financial stability. But the uncertainty sparked by the tariffs would hurt Australia, and our economy would be hit in other indirect ways, she said. She said that explained why the RBA revised its official forecasts recently to anticipate weaker growth, lower inflation and a slightly higher unemployment rate over the next 12 months. \"Global uncertainty may weigh substantially on domestic activity if uncertainty remains elevated,\" she warned. She said the RBA Board's decision tocut interest rateslast month was also informed by this analysis of the problems that flowed from heightened uncertainty in the global economy. She made her commentsin a speechto the Economic Society of Australia Queensland on Tuesday afternoon. Ms Hunter said uncertainty was \"a bit of a slippery concept\" and there were lots of ways to try to measure it. She said one way \u2014 the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU) \u2014 was based on the number of news articles that mentioned policy uncertainty. Another way \u2014 the volatility index (VIX) \u2014 was a measure that captured how uncertain financial markets were about near-term equity prices. But she said both of those indices saw a sharp rise in uncertainty after Donald Trump's tariff announcement in April, although the VIX has declined in recent weeks. See the graph below. Both measures of uncertainty rose sharply after Donald Trump announced his sweeping tariffs. And she said there was \"ample evidence\" that higher uncertainty could lead to declines in investment, output and employment and Australia was not immune from that dynamic. \"Typically, higher uncertainty leads firms to delay decisions that are costly to reverse, like investment and hiring,\" she said. \"This makes sense intuitively because there is value in waiting to see how things are playing out before making a decision that is (at least partially) non-reversible. The RBA decreases the cash rate by 0.25 of a percentage point, to 3.85 per cent. It is the second cut to rates this year, providing some further relief to home loan borrowers. \"Some studies find higher uncertainty also has a measurable impact on household consumption, but this is typically more modest. \"Research suggests that the negative impacts of higher policy uncertainty \u2014 including trade policy \u2014 are largest for businesses, as they typically pull back on investment,\" she said. She said that if we saw businesses and households responding as they had in the past, then the current level of uncertainty \"will weigh materially on global activity\". \"But the unpredictability and unprecedented nature of the current situation makes it hard to be precise on the size of the impact,\" she warned. She said at this stage, the RBA's \"baseline scenario\" for its official forecasts assumed that the prevailing level of global uncertainty would have a \"relatively modest drag\" on Australia's economy. But she said if a global trade war erupted, we could see a \"substantial pull-back in activity\" in Australia. Overall, Ms Hunter said the RBA would monitor carefully how things unfolded in coming months. She said the RBA's economists would be watching \"key transmission channels\" through which the United States' proposed trade tariffs would impact Australia's economy, in their different ways. She said those channels included: And she emphasised how difficult it had become to produce forecasts of economic activity in such a febrile environment. \"How will the current unpredictable and uncertain global environment transmit through to the Australian economy?\" she asked. \"The short answer is, we can't be completely sure. In last week's market chaos, traders turned their backs on US government bonds. Is Donald Trump destroying America's \"exorbitant privilege\"? \"The broad-based nature of the proposed US tariffs, retaliation from major partners and other policy shifts all have the potential to structurally alter the world economy. \"[Our] baseline forecast is for recent global developments to contribute to slower economic growth in Australia and a slightly weaker labour market. \"We also anticipate that, overall, the price of tradable goods will be slightly dampened. \"Together, these two outcomes mean that inflation is forecast to be a little lower than at the February Statement on Monetary Policy, settling around the midpoint of the 2-3 per cent target range. \"This forecast is based on several judgments and assumptions about the potency of the transmission channels I have discussed today,\" she said.",

        "summary": "Tech billionaire Elon Musk has attacked US President Donald Trump in a tweet, calling his tax cuts legislation a \"disgusting abomination\". Mr Musk's criticism of the legislation comes just days after leaving his role as adviser to the US president.",
        "raw_text": "Tech billionaire Elon Musk has launched an extraordinary attack on Donald Trump's sprawling tax cuts legislation, set to add $US3 trillion ($4.64 trillion) to the nation's debt, calling it a \"disgusting abomination\". Just days after leaving his role as adviser to the US president, the Tesla entrepreneur and Republican donor called the mammoth policy package \"outrageous\". The legislation would see the US administration extend tax relief through budget cuts that are projected to strip health care from millions of low-income Americans who rely on Medicaid. The billionaire and former head of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency says he has concerns about how the bill will expand the federal deficit. The legislation, which Mr Trump is calling his \"big, beautiful bill\", passed the House of Representatives earlier this week and is set to be the subject of fierce debate in the Senate. Mr Musk, who until recently held a cost-cutting role in the Trump administration, has intervened to place his opposition to the bill on record. Posting on X, he said he \"just can't stand it anymore\", adding: \"This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. \"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.\" When White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked how angry she thought Mr Trump would be about Mr Musk's tweet, she said it would not change the president's stance on the bill. \"Look, the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill. It doesn't change the president's opinion. This is one big, beautiful bill and he's sticking to it,\" she said at a press conference. The White House said the legislation would spur robust economic growth to neutralise its potential to blow up America's already burgeoning debt pile, which has ballooned to $US36.9 trillion. But several independent analyses have found that \u2014 even taking growth into account \u2014 it will add between $US2.5 trillion and $US3.1 trillion to deficits over the next decade. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, found that the combined effects of tax cuts and cost savings would result in a significant transfer of wealth from the poorest 10 per cent to the richest 10 per cent. Republicans muscled the measure through the House by a single vote on May 22, a combination of bargaining with vote holdouts on policies and deploying Mr Trump himself to twist arms. House Speaker Mike Johnson is now pleading with the Senate not to alter the bill too much, as any tweaks would need to go back to the lower chamber. ABC/wires",

        "summary": "The Fair Work Commission has handed down an increase of 3.5 per cent to the national minimum wage and award minimum wages at its annual review. It equates to an increase of about $32 for a 38-hour working week, or nearly $1,670 a year.",
        "raw_text": "Millions of Australian workers will get a 3.5 per cent pay rise from July 1, following the Fair Work Commission's (FWC) annual review of the minimum wage and award agreements. The commission's decision increases the national minimum wage to $24.95 per hour or $948 per week, based on a full-time, 38-hour working week. Inflation is currently at 2.4 per cent annually. While the national minimum wage covers a small proportion of the workforce, about a fifth of all employees in Australia are paid at a minimum award rate. Workers reliant on award wages are disproportionately female and more than half are employed casually, while two-thirds work part-time hours and more than a third are low paid. This means the wages paid to award workers only make up 10.5 per cent of the national \"wage bill\", the FWC noted. Award workers are concentrated in the accommodation and food services, health care and social assistance, retail trade, and administrative and support services sectors. William Seamons, a corporate security guard based in regional Victoria, described the increase as \"awesome\". William Seamons will see his pay increase after the annual ruling.(ABC News: Emilia Terzon) Mr Seamons is paid under the security level 5 award rate and expects to see his pay increase by just over $1 an hour. \"The industry does need a pay rise\u2026 it's overdue and it'll make a difference for a lot of people,\" he said. The above-inflation wages rise addresses some of the decline in real wages experienced by minimum wage and award wage workers in recent years. \"The principal decision which has guided our decision is the fact that, since July 2021, the real value of modern award wages \u2026 has declined by 4.5 percentage points relative to inflation,\" the review read. The FWC said at its last three annual decisions, it put off taking action to reverse the decline in real wages \"out of a concern that this might result in the further persistence of higher inflation\". It said with inflation now back within the Reserve Bank's 2-3 per cent target range, it has now taken the opportunity to go some of the way to correcting the decline in real wages. \"We are concerned that if this opportunity is not taken in this Review, the loss in the real value of wages which has occurred will become permanently embedded in the modern award system, and the [national minimum wage] and a reduction in living standards for the lowest paid in the community will thereby be entrenched,\" the decision stated. Hospitality, health and social services, retail and admin workers are particularly reliant on award wages.(AAP: Alan Porritt, file photo) The FWC ruling was announced today after lobbying from various groups. The federal government had argued for an \"economically sustainable real wage increase\" \u2014 while not putting a firm figure on its request, it indicated support for a wage rise above inflation. Following the decision, Employment Minister Amanda Rishworth said it was \"consistent\" with what the government had called for in its submission. \"This represents a real wage increase to close to 3 million workers right across this country. \"It will mean, for those on the minimum wage, for those working full-time, a close to a $1,700 annual increase.\" Productivity is dominating headlines, but is it really possible to measure in Australia? Business groups including the Australian Retailers Association and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry had called for no more than 2.5 per cent, arguing any more would put too much pressure on employers. Australian Industry Group was slightly higher at 2.6 per cent. Meanwhile, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) had lobbied for a rise of up to 4.5 per cent. ACTU secretary Sally McManus welcomed the FWC decision, describing it as a \"great outcome\". \"It's 1.1 per cent more than inflation, so it means that, finally, award wage workers in Australia \u2014 our lowest-paid workers \u2014 are getting ahead again,\" she told a press conference. \"The Fair Work Commission accepted the arguments made by unions that it was time for low-wage workers, award workers, to start catching up for what was lost during the inflation spike.\" The Council of Small Business Organisations Australia (COSBOA) said small businesses would be the ones footing the bill for the wage increase. \"Small businesses are facing a cost crisis across energy, rent, insurance and input costs,\" COSBOA chief executive Luke Achterstraat said. \"Today's decision of a 3.5 per cent increase, which is above the current rate of inflation, will have ramifications for our small business engine room, many of whom are struggling to make a profit on already razor-thin margins. \"For every dollar increase in the award rate, employers also face higher levels of workers compensation, payroll tax and, of course, another legislated increase in the superannuation guarantee from July 1.\" John Buchanan from the University of Sydney Business School described it as a \"disappointing but pretty predictable\" outcome. Professor Buchanan said the FWC had \"offered a modest real wage increase this year after presiding over real wage cuts since 2021\". \"They also noted continuing to hold wages down will not help overcome the productivity problem,\" he told ABC News. \"In their minds they've trodden a middle path \u2014 not catching up completely but, equally, not holding back until aggregate productivity picks up.\" Westpac economists have maintained their forecast of wage inflation of 3.4 per cent mid-year, easing to 3.1 per cent by December. \"A softer labour market will see weaker wages growth from individual bargaining arrangements, offsetting a lift from enterprise bargaining and a slower moderation in award/minimum wages,\" senior economist Justin Smirk wrote. TheFWC boosted the minimum wage and awards by 3.75 per cent last year,after higher inflation pushed real wage growth further down in comparison.",

Financial crime and money-laundering regulator AUSTRAC has announced new controls on crypto ATM operators, including $5,000 transaction limits. The rapid growth of crypto ATMs has outpaced regulation, with the machines increasingly used for illicit purposes, AUSTRAC says.",
        "raw_text": "Australians are losing millions of dollars each year to scams linked to cryptocurrency ATMs and older people have been the group most caught up in illicit activity through the machines. Financial crimes agency AUSTRAC has now intervened \u2014 introducing sweeping industry-wide controls after uncovering links to scams, money laundering and other illegal activity. The regulator has also refused to renew one crypto ATM (CATM) operator's registration. Cryptocurrency ATMs are located across the country \u2014 in petrol stations, convenience stores, supermarkets and takeaway shops. They allow users to convert cash into digital currencies like Bitcoin, which is transferred to a digital wallet. Some machines also let users cash out their cryptocurrency. With banks under growing pressure to crack down on scams and money laundering, authorities warn crypto ATMs are being exploited by criminals. Following a three-month analysis of data from nine crypto ATM operators, AUSTRAC has confirmed the machines are being used for scam and fraud-related transactions. The ABC understands the regulator was able to trace some transactions to scam hotspots in Asia and Europe, as well as groups linked to organised crime. Crypto ATM operators will now face a $5,000 limit on cash deposits and withdrawals, in an effort to limit the financial fallout of scams. AUSTRAC will also enforce enhanced customer due diligence requirements, mandatory scam warnings and more robust transaction monitoring obligations on the operators. The new controls come as fresh data from the Australian Federal Police (AFP) reveals Australians are losing millions of dollars each year to scams involving crypto ATMs. \"These conditions are designed to help protect individuals from scams by deterring criminals from directing them to a crypto ATM, as well as to protect businesses from criminal exploitation,\" AUSTRAC chief executive Brendan Thomas told ABC News. Brendan Thomas is the CEO of financial crimes agency AUSTRAC.(ABC News: Daniel Irvine) \"In light of the risks and harms, we consider it absolutely necessary to ensure the sector meets minimum standards and reduces the criminal misuse of crypto ATMs. \"We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these conditions and adjust them if needed.\" As part of the compliance crackdown, AUSTRAC has refused to renew the registration of Harro's Empires, a small South Australian crypto ATM operator. The company was ordered to shut down its four machines after the agency found ongoing risks that criminals could exploit them. \"This action draws a clear line in the sand and serves as a warning to other digital currency exchange providers that aren't meeting their responsibilities under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act,\" Mr Thomas said. Australians lost $3 million to scams involving crypto ATMs in the 12 months to January, according to reports made to the Australian Cyber Security Centre. Of the 150 reported incidents, the most common scams were investment scams (63), extortion emails (35), and romance scams (24). Most victims were women over 51. However, total losses are likely to be far higher, as many victims do not report these crimes. \"Australia is certainly a key target, given we have high levels of savings and wealth,\" AFP assistant commissioner for cyber command Richard Chin told ABC News. Richard Chin says at least $3 million was lost in scams involving cash deposits at cryptocurrency ATMs in the year to January.(ABC News: Daniel Irvine) Mr Chin said that once cash is converted into cryptocurrency and sent to a digital wallet, it's nearly impossible to retrieve. The scammer instructed the man to make several bank withdrawals and deposit the money into crypto ATMs. His funds could not be recovered. \"That money goes into an elaborate web of global money laundering and ultimately ends up back with the criminal organisations orchestrating these scams and running them at an industrial scale around the world.\" Australia has the third-highest number of crypto ATMs in the world, behind the United States and Canada \u2014 making it the fastest-growing market globally. In 2019, there were just 23 machines nationwide. Today, there are more than 1,800. \"The speed of the growth has concerned us,\" Mr Thomas told ABC News. \"We're worried that growth may be based on illicit activity and people being scammed. \"We're not only worried about people being victims of scams, we're also concerned about drug purchases and other money-laundering activities occurring through cryptocurrency ATMs.\" There are more than 1,800 crypto ATMs in Australia.(Source: Coin ATM Radar.) AUSTRAC estimates around $275 million flows through these machines each year across roughly 150,000 transactions. The vast majority \u2014 around 99 per cent \u2014 are cash deposits used to purchase cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoin, Tether and Ethereum. Based on its analysis, AUSTRAC believes one in 10 transactions may be linked to illegitimate activity, including drug trafficking, scams, and organised crime. \"Cryptocurrency as an industry represents a significant global money-laundering risk. \"We see eye-watering sums of money moving across borders for drug purchases, and the proceeds are being scammed,\" Mr Thomas said. Leigh Stark says if someone is asking you to buy them Bitcoin, it is most likely a scam.(ABC News: David Sciasci) The age profile of crypto ATM users has shocked regulators and closely aligns with the demographic most commonly targeted by international scams. People over 50 account for nearly 72 per cent of crypto ATM transactions by value. Those aged between 60 and 70 make up 29 per cent of all transaction value. These findings are echoed by at least one Melbourne petrol station worker, who spoke to the ABC on condition of anonymity. He said he typically sees two or three older people each week depositing cash into the on-site cryptocurrency ATM. Most, he said, are on the phone receiving step-by-step instructions from someone on how to use the machine. Robert was asked to deposit money into a crypto ATM after being targeted by online scammers.(ABC News: John Gunn) Most scam victims are first contacted online. Last year, Robert (whose name we've changed to protect his privacy) unwittingly became a money mule after applying for a work-from-home job he found online. \"They sent me a contract to sign \u2014 passport, driver's licence, bank account details, the lot,\" he said. At first, he was asked to perform simple online tasks like writing product reviews. But later, he received instructions to withdraw money deposited by his 'employer' and put it into a crypto ATM. \"She told me to take a photo of the ATM when I got there,\" Robert recalled. \"Then she sent back photos with instructions on what buttons to press. I'd never used one of those machines before \u2014 it took me about half an hour to figure it out.\" He was told to open a second account at another bank and over several weeks, he deposited thousands of dollars into a digital wallet through his local crypto ATM. Eventually, his banks flagged the activity. \"They said I might have been involved in something fraudulent. I was worried. I'm not that kind of person.\" Robert reported the incident to the ACCC's Scamwatch, which advised him to cancel all forms of ID and cease contact with the scammers. Crypto ATMs have made international headlines for the wrong reasons. They've been effectively banned in countries like the United Kingdom and Singapore, and are heavily restricted in others. Cryptocurrency devotees are riding the recent crypto wave fuelled by Donald Trump's re-election in the US. But Australian industry figures says businesses and consumers are being let down by a lack of regulation. In the US, lawmakers are considering new legislation to regulate the industry. Several lawsuits have already been filed, including one by the state of Iowa, which is suing operators Bitcoin Depot and CoinFlip for $US20 million ($31 million) over scam losses. In Australia, AUSTRAC last year established a dedicated taskforce to investigate the sector and introduced new compliance requirements aimed at stopping misuse. But Mr Thomas acknowledges that regulation hasn't kept pace with the industry's rapid growth. He has called for broader regulation of the cryptocurrency sector to support legitimate operators and protect consumers. \"Our taskforce is working to understand the money-laundering risks of cryptocurrency in Australia and is collaborating closely with industry to determine the controls we need,\" he said. A Localcoin-branded Bitcoin ATM in Canberra.(ABC News: David Sciasci) Global players such as CoinFlip, Localcoin, ByteFederal and Bitcoin Depot are competing for market share against local players in Australia's booming crypto ATM market. Operators charge users commissions of up to 20 per cent per transaction, in addition to other fees. The industry's peak body, the Digital Economy Council of Australia (DECA), acknowledges some ATMs are being exploited for scams and money laundering. However, DECA chair Paul Derham argued most customers are legitimate traders simply trying to access digital assets in the face of banking restrictions. \"One of the challenges Australians face is that if they want to buy crypto, sometimes their banks won't let them. \"So they withdraw cash and go to a crypto ATM instead,\" said Mr Derham, who is also a lawyer representing several global ATM operators. Mr Derham said while there are different views, broadly speaking the industry does not support transaction limits of $5,000. He said there would be additional compliance costs for businesses. Mr Derham said customers may also use multiple CATMs to get around the new conditions. \"The industry would prefer to control these thresholds themselves using their own risk-based approach \u2014 which they are legally required to do anyway. \"For example, if a person is considered low risk and has a long history with a CATM provider, they should have a higher threshold.\" Asked whether the business would remain viable if they could no longer be used for scams and money laundering, Mr Derham said: \"No-one's been able to crack the code to stop scams. Even Australia's biggest banks haven't been able to completely eliminate the risk. \"The reality is that some scams are being run by highly coordinated international networks \u2014 including state-backed actors \u2014 who are actively targeting vulnerable people.\"",

        "raw_text": "The corporate regulator is suing insurance comparison provider Choosi for allegedly misleading customers through its insurance comparison services. In proceedings filed to the Federal Court, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) alleges Choosi has misled Australians by claiming to compare a range of funeral and life insurers. On its website, Choosi states: \"Compare the benefits and prices of a range of products from leading insurers so you can confidently choose cover that suits your needs, budget and lifestyle.\" ASIC alleges Choosi has misled Australians by stating it compares a range of funeral and life insurers.(ABC News: Adelaide Miller) However, ASIC claims that from the middle of July 2019, Choosi has only compared policies issued by a single insurer, except for on one occasion. \"Choosi is only comparing one insurer \u2014 Hannover Insurance \u2014 and so we're concerned that the representations to those consumers who looked at the website and heard that advertising have been misled,\" ASIC's deputy chair Sarah Court told The Business. Sarah Court alleges Choosi was being used as a platform to distribute Hannover products.(ABC News: Carl Saville) ASIC alleges that while the three funeral insurance products on Choosi's website have different branding, they are all issued by Hannover. Similarly, despite Choosi comparing five life insurance policies with different branding, they are once again all issued by Hannover \u2014 except for the period prior to July 2023, when Choosi included a single policy from an additional insurer. ASIC says all policies were distributed by Greenstone Financial Services \u2014 a company associated with Choosi. \"From a consumers perspective, they've come onto a website, they're told we will compare a range of products from a number of leading insurers,\" says Ms Court. Hannover is a global insurance provider with two entities in Australia \u2014 property and casualty insurance, and life and health insurance. ASIC is alleging Hannover paid Choosi about $61 million in commissions since 2019 to solely advertise products from its company on the comparison website. ASIC alleges Hannover paid Choosi about $61 million in commissions since 2019 to solely advertise products from its company on the comparison website.(ABC News: Adelaide Miller) \"What we're seeing here is the Choosi platform really being used by Hannover as just a platform to distribute its products, with no comparison going on with other insurers at all,\" says Ms Court. In a statement to the ABC, a spokesperson for Hannover has said: \"Hannover acknowledges the recent concerns raised by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) regarding certain products that appear on the Choosi website. \"As this is an ongoing legal matter before the court, we are unable to comment further at this time. We remain committed to providing our customers with insurance solutions that suit their needs.\" Ms Court says \"millions of people\" would have been exposed to Choosi's messaging over the six years since this arrangement began. \"We know that this was a very widespread advertising campaign by Choosi over many years... and we know there have been thousands of policies that have been sold,\" says Ms Court. ASIC alleges Choosi made the misleading representations on its website, across social media, and via television commercials and advertorials. Choosi says it finds policies from a range of trusted insurance brands.(Supplied) From July 1, 2019, until November 30, 2024, 4,225 funeral insurance policies and 9,478 life insurance policies have been sold. Ms Court has told the ABC if the Federal Court finds Choosi has misled customers, then \"it will be important for [ASIC] to seek substantial penalties\". \"[It's] to send a message to Choosi, but also as importantly, to send a message to the broader industry and others that run comparison websites\u2026 \"If you want to run these kind of sites then you certainly have to be very open and transparent with consumers about what it is that you're comparing.\" In a statement to the ABC, a spokesperson for Choosi said: \"Choosi is aware of the concerns raised by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) regarding certain aspects of our advertising. Choosi is currently reviewing the allegations and will take all the necessary steps and will respond accordingly. \"Our customers are at the heart of what we do. We are committed to making any necessary changes that best serves our customers.\" Ms Court says insurance comparison websites have an important role when they are operated and used correctly. \"We know that people are finding it difficult to afford insurance, difficult to access insurance, and so comparison websites could play a really important role in helping consumers with what is out there and helping them choose the products that are best for them.\" But she warns consumers to be \"wary\". \"[These comparison sites] are effectively commercial businesses, they make money in certain ways. \"So with Choosi, it was from getting commissions paid to it from the one insurer whose products it was selling,\" she says. While she urges consumers to do some \"due diligence\" by checking the policy's product disclosure statements, she says the onus is on the provider to do the right thing. \"Anyone that is a commercial provider offering a comparison website, you have to be up-front with what it is you are comparing, you need to be transparent with anyone, any consumer that's coming on to use your site.\"",

        "raw_text": "There is hope an Australia-first service using satellites to deliver text messages anywhere in the country will grow to become a game changer for Australians in mobile black spots. Telstra has launched a mobile-to-satellite service for some customers, delivered through SpaceX's Starlink service. While currently only available on select new phones, the technology is considered a significant breakthrough, providing coverage for people outside land-based 4G and 5G networks. Communications analyst Graham Lynch said while it was still early days, the technology had massive implications for rural Australians. Channa\u00a0Seneviratne is responsible for technical advancement at Telstra.(Supplied: Telstra) Initially, customers will only be able to text message using the service, and it will only work on a Samsung Galaxy S25 handset. Telstra's executive for technology engagement, Channa Seneviratne, said it was working to add additional handsets. \"In time, there will be more, including future support for Apple devices,\" Mr Seneviratne said. He said the service would be part of the standard contract, so there would be no extra charges, but he warned there could be some delays in sending and receiving messages. \"If the satellite is not quite overhead, it could take a few minutes,\" he said. Accompanying the rollout of the new service are questions about its reliability. Mr Lynch said testing of similar services in the United States produced patchy results. \"Messages get dropped, messages get missed,\" he said. Telstra is partnering with SpaceX to deliver text messaging via low Earth orbit satellites.(Supplied: Telstra) He said getting a reliable connection was challenging because low-Earth-orbit satellites (LEOsats) themselves are moving at about 25,000 kilometres per hour. \"The LEOsats are spinning very fast around a planet that is itself spinning very fast, so there's a lot of calibration involved in the physics,\" he said. The new messaging service uses LEOsats and direct-to-device (D2D) technology to transmit signals from space directly to mobile phones. Telstra is partnering with SpaceX to deliver text messaging services across Australia to areas without mobile coverage.(Supplied: Telstra) Users will connect automatically to the Starlink satellite if they are beyond the range of Telstra's mobile network on mainland Australia and Tasmania, excluding the Australian Radio Quiet Zone in Western Australia and remote offshore territories and islands. Many rural Australians are already using LEOsats to connect to services like Starlink, Sky Muster, Intelsat and Inmarsat for internet browsing, email, voice calls and texting. But the CEO of the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, Warren Pearce, said the technology had potentially life-saving implications for prospectors and others working remotely. People living and working remotely will be able to send a text message via their smart phone for the first time.(ABC News: Zara Margolis) Telstra said the service did not connect to emergency services yet and users would have to text a third party to call triple-0. TPG-Vodafone has already tested a service and Optus is working on it as well. Telstra is working on enabling voice calls using the LEOsat network, but it will not be available until 2027. Mr Pearce said that would be significant. \"If we can get to a point where we can make contact and have a conversation in every part of Australia, I think that would be a major breakthrough,\" he said. Warren Pearce says Telstra enabling voice calls using the LEOsat network will be significant.(ABC News: Phil Hemingway) Labor promised to include LEOsat services in thefederal government's universal mobile service obligation (UMSO) by 2027if it was elected at the most recent poll. This would require telcos to offer satellite services alongside mobile and fixed services. If that happens, Australia will be the first country in the world to take that step. Mr Lynch said other countries like the US and New Zealand were offering the service, but reliability was still an issue. \"They're not at the level where they can provide guarantees, which is what makes what Australia is planning to do so novel,\" he said.",

        "raw_text": "The AFL\u2019s expansion into Tasmania is on a knife edge as the state\u2019s politicians consider a move to oust premier Jeremy Rockliff, which could trigger a state election and potentially torpedo the Devils\u2019 plans to join the league. The Devils on Wednesday said the political uncertainty was cause for \u201cgreat concern\u201d and presented \u201ca serious risk \u2026 for the future of Tasmania Football Club\u201d. The club, which hasalready attracted 210,000 members, is due to enter the competition in 2028 under an agreement with the AFL, and move into the newly complete venue on the Hobart waterfront the following year. One of the conditions set by the AFL for a new team in Tasmania was a roofed stadium, but the expensive project \u2013 set to cost around $1bn \u2013 faces opposition from some in Tasmania, who instead have called for the money to be spent elsewhere. The Greens have declared they support a motion of no-confidence in the premier put forward by the opposition leader, Labor\u2019s Dean Winter. In Parliament on Wednesday morning, Greens leader Dr Rosalie Woodruff called for the motion to explicitly mention the government\u2019s handling of the stadium. But Winter responded by saying he would not support the amendment, and the no-confidence motion was focused on the state of the budget. In a dramatic day in Hobart, Devils\u2019 head of corporate affairs Kath McCann was emotional at a press conference as she described there is no \u201cplan B\u201d to renegotiate the deal with the AFL. \u201cIt\u2019d be fair to say that the level of uncertainty would be significantly heightened, and in fact, some of those scenarios don\u2019t beg thinking about for the club here today,\u201d McCann said, via the ABC. \u201cThe optics nationally and internationally are really negative for Tasmania, what this looks like is uncertainly, a risk to invest and a state that isn\u2019t unified.\u201d The Devils had earlier taken the unusual step of offering a public statement amidst the political uncertainty. \u201cWe ask that our political leaders understand the implications of their actions and decisions on the future of our state for all Tasmanians, a future which we know Tasmania Football Club can play a significant part,\u201d it said. On Tuesday in Melbourne, AFL chief executive Andrew Dillon said the competition had already been planning for the weekly bye for one team that would come with entry of the Devils as 19th team, and anticipated the stadium\u2019s enabling legislation would be discussed in the lower house later this month and the upper house early in July. \u201cThe Tasmanian government and [Devils CEO] Brendon Gale and the Tassie Devils have done a power of work and we\u2019re really confident in 2028,\u201d he said.",

        "raw_text": "At 4-1, Gauff says Keys was playing well,hitting it hard and low, so she just had to fight. She acknowledges her opponent has perhaps the best forehand in the game, so she\u2019d have to run and as soon as she got a short ball, punish it. Her last match was played in warmer conditions, so she reduced tension in her racket strings for this match, changed it at 1-4 and went 5-4, though she doesn\u2019t know if that made the difference. She thought with the roof closed the court would play slower which it did in some moments, but it also played quicker, which was perhaps because of her opponent\u2019s power. Otherwise, she\u2019s delighted to be in the semi; she\u2019ll enjoy the feeling today, then come back firing tomorrow. Keys will be so disappointed with how she played today.Her biggest weapon, her forehand, was her biggest enemy, and she just couldn\u2019t get herself going. But here\u2019s Coco, leather jacked donned! *Keys 7-6(6) 4-6 1-6 GauffServing to stay in the match, Keys errs twice for 0-30, but this time she\u2019s prompted to by the improved consistency of Gauff\u2019s hitting. And have a look! A squash shot, zoned down the line, raises three match points, and one final forehand, butchered long, sends Gauff into the last four, where she\u2019ll meet Boisson or Andreeva. She\u2019ll need to play a lot better in that one. Keys 7-6(6) 4-6 1-5 Gauff*Gauff opens the game with a nervous double \u2013 merely fair serving and this match would already be over \u2013 but it looks like momentum is unassailable hers and she soon leads 30-15. Keys, though, steps into a pair of forehands, the second a clean winner, and the feeling persists that if she hit a streak, her bigger game would take her to victory. That doesn\u2019t, though, look at all likely, Gauff responding with a drop followed by a body-serve that Keys can\u2019t return. Champion that she is, she\u2019s found her best form in the clutch; so far this set, she\u2019s made just two unforced errors, one of those a double, and she\u2019s a game away. *Keys 7-6(6) 4-6 1-4 GauffKeys\u2019 easy power is a joke, a buggy-whip forehand making 15-all, then a big serve and backhand clean-up nudging her in front. But another unforced error levels the game, a fantastic backhand winner raises a point for the double break \u2026 then Keys remembers who she is, a pair of booming backhands taking us to deuce. Gauff, though, knows she\u2019s playing the better, lands a huge forehand return on to the line, then steps in and gets on top of one, above shoulder-height, dispensing a terrific winner, and when a backhand, potentially framed, catches the sideline and dies \u2013 Gauff raises a hand in mortification \u2013 the no 2 seed has the double break. She\u2019s two games away. Keys 7-6(6) 4-6 1-3 Gauff*Gauff might just\u2019ve settled in time. She holds to love, playing her game, and if that continues, Keys will need to improve significantly if she\u2019s to win. *Keys 7-6(6) 4-6 1-2 GauffNow a love hold for Keys, and that\u2019ll fortify her with at least a soup\u00e7on of confidence as she seeks a break back. The standard so far in this set has been a little better than what\u2019s come before it. Keys 7-6(6) 4-6 0-2 Gauff*This is the Keys that used to be, capable of the very best and very worst, often in the same point. Gauff consolidates to love, and has she made the definitive move? *Keys 7-6(6) 4-6 0-1 GauffKeys does brilliantly to stick in the longest rally of the match, retrieving an overhead before lasering a backhand winner down the line. But when she goes again next point, she misses by a fraction, then sends down a double \u2026 partially redeemed by two big groundstrokes that make 30-all. Again, though, Keys can\u2019t string quality points together, a winner then an error taking us to deuce, whereupon similar happens and round we go again. This time, though, Keys nets a backhand, then a corner-to-corner forehand is fractionally wide, her 50th unforced error of the match, and Gauff leads by a break in the decider! \u201c\u2018If either player delivered delivered this level against Swiatek or Sabalenka, they\u2019d get absolutely tumped\u2019,\u201d says Harry Spencer, quoting me back to myself. \u201cForget about Swiatek or Sabalenka, Mirra Andreeva will obliterate either of these players at this standard.\u201d I can\u2019t argue with that. Keys 7-6(6) 4-6 Gauff*A backhand error hands Gauff 0-15 but a fine forehand return levels the game and we\u2019re soon as 30-all. From there, though, Keys wafts a backhand long to raise set point, then swats a backhand into the net, and we\u2019re level at a set apiece! I\u2019ve not a clue what\u2019s going to happen next and i doubt the players do either. *Keys 7-6(6) 4-5 GauffKeys looks to have earned 15-0 but Gauff smokes a backhand winner cross; that\u2019s the best shot she\u2019s played so far. At 0-30, though, Keys again unleashes, big forehands halving the deficit, before another error means she\u2019s down two break-points. Before the game, her coach and husband told her not to offer width when serving into the deuce court and she listens to the advice to save the first, but Gauff then digs out a terrific forehand to the corner, and will shortly save for a dismal second set. Keys 7-6(6) 4-4 Gauff*Gauff\u2019s first serve of the game is way long and a tame second delivery allows a monstered return and overhead; 0-15. I can\u2019t remember the last time I saw two players of such rare talent play so poorly at the same time; Chrissy is shocked, and she\u2019s seen a bit. Gosh and, as I type, Keys makes 15-40 then slams a forehand into the net, her go-to shot losing her as much as it\u2019s winning. But two more bigguns convert the second break point and we\u2019re back on serve at 4-4 in the second! Has Keys hit a bit of form just in time to close out? *Keys 7-6(6) 3-4 GauffIt\u2019s no surprise our players started nervously, but it is unusual that the same feeling still suffuses proceedings. We learn that 26% of Keys\u2019 forehands are unforced errors and Chrissy notes she doesn\u2019t really have a B-game, then another mistake from Gauff prompts her to lament \u201cso many unforced errors\u201d. Keys holds to 15 and pressure on the world no 2 ratchets up another level. Keys 7-6(6) 2-4 Gauff*I nip to resolve a quick intestinal situation, return to see Keys has 15-40, and though Gauff wins the next point, yet another double \u2013 her ninth so far \u2013 returns one of her two breaks. *Keys 7-6(6) 1-4 GauffTell you what, if either player delivered delivered this level against Swiatek or Sabalenka, they\u2019d get absolutely tumped. Keys just can\u2019t find winners often enough, given how regularly she goes for them, the unforced error count piling up, and when, at 15-40, she serves into the slot, a lusty forehand swing down the line secures the double break. Gauff is in total control of the set. Keys 7-6(6) 1-3 Gauff*Keys has dropped, but at 40-15 a decent return sets up the point and gives her a chance, then another on to the tootsies takes us to deuce. Gauff, though, usually a fine mover, didn\u2019t get herself out of the way, and it might cost her because a gorgeous cross-court forehand return, almost a table tennis shot, means she\u2019s down advantage. Two quick errors, from Keys, though, and suddenly it\u2019s game point, a return whizzing long to secure the consolidation. This isn\u2019t getting less tense. *Keys 7-6(6) 1-2 GauffNice from Gauff, sending Keys out wide before hitting into the space for 15-30, and a forehand into the net quickly hands her two break points. And this time, Keys doesn\u2019t find a first serve, but Gauff still returns into the net \u2013 \u201chard to watch,\u201d laments Chrissy \u2013 then another Keys error means the world no 2 is up a break. Can she consolidate? Keys 7-6(6) 1-1 Gauff*At 15-all, Gauff slices an ace out wide and Keys then goes long, but again, the errors are never far away and we wind up at deuce. Gauff, though, gets lucky, when two poor serves are returned into the net, and we\u2019re level in set two. Can either player find any consistency? *Keys 7-6(6) 1-0 GauffThe best sportsfolk have the memory of a goldfish, able to forget their worst errors and focus on whatever\u2019s next; Gauff will need to do that, because it was her three double faults that settled the first set. And very quickly, she makes 15-40; keys saves the first break point with a classic one-two punch, first serve out wide, forehand walloped into the opposite corner. A big serve then sets up the next rally, again finished with +1 forehand, but Gauff makes advantage \u2026 again confiscated via forehand winner. Gauff, though, has her own forehand going and uses it to raise a fourth break point \u2026 this time removed via big first serve, Keys continuing to find them when she really needs them. But have a look! Up advantage and at the net, she hits wide with the whole court open \u2026 then secures the hold with two quick points. Both players are hitting some great shots and some total donkeys. Keys 7-6(6) GauffKeys finds another first serve, Gauff\u2019s return is wide, and a set no one deserved to win goes to the Aussie Open champ. This match isn\u2019t of the standard we\u2019d hoped, but it\u2019s still impossible to look away. Keys 6-6 Gauff (7-6)Gauff doesn\u2019t let her or us find out, a gorgeous drop restoring parity \u2026 but after a fault, no one can be surprised when the second serve goes into the net. That\u2019s a third double of the breaker, and you could see her collapse under the toss, sending the ball low into the net. Keys 6-6 Gauff (6-5)Keys\u2019 forehand is losing her as many points as it\u2019s winning; when she\u2019s nervous she tends to go bigger and Gauff is constantly asking the question. And goodness me, how many she\u2019s forced to play to make 5-5! But she gets there in the end, then dominates the next rally for 6-5, and will now receive set-point to the good. Has she rediscovered her range just in time? Keys 6-6 Gauff (4-4)Gauff again keeps the ball in play long enough to elicit the error and this time it means she takes the mini-break; the longer the rally, the more likely she is to win it. But at 4-3, her second double of the breaker takes us back level, neither player able to hit well enough for long enough to take control. Keys 6-6 Gauff (2-3)Immediate mini-break to Keys via colossal double, but Gauff defends really well in the next point, hanging in it long enough to see an attempted winner hit the net. A poor drop then invites Gauff to the net, but Keys threads a devastating forehand through a tiny hole between player and sideline and we\u2019re at 2-1; two holds and the world no 2 leads, on serve. *Keys 6-6 GauffKeys is finding first serves when she needs them most, making 15-0 only to thwack a forehand cross just wide. And when she then nets a backhand, Gauff is two points away from the set \u2026 but a forehand down and on to the line makes 30-all. These are high tariff, low percentage shots from Keys, who reaches game point then switches the momentum of the next rally with a forehand so good it elicits an involuntary gasp from Naomi Cavaday. To the breaker we go! Keys 5-6 Gauff*A love hold! I think that\u2019s the first of the set, and Keys will now serve to stay in it. I\u2019ve not a clue what\u2019s going to happen next, but my sense is both players will try and let go of their biggest shots. Gauff might try to hang in pints waiting for errors, but so far she\u2019s looked most convincing when playing positively. *Keys 5-5 GauffIt\u2019d be wrong to say Gauff\u2019s improvement has precipitated Keys\u2019 deterioration \u2013 if anything, it\u2019s the other way around. In comms, Chrissy \u2013 the player least pervious to nerves in the game\u2019s history \u2013 blames them, and she should know. But I also wonder if a little bit of complacency is to blame: at 4-1 40-15, perhaps she felt the set was hers. Either way, we wind up at deuce, Gauff sends a forehand down the line, and Keys nets on the backhand to cede set point; she badly needs a first serve, finds a high-kicker to the backhand, then opens her body to rude a big bounce and punish an inside-out forehand winner, cross-court. Another first serve then helps make advantage, and from there, another fine point secures the hold; what a funny set this is, Keys rediscovering herself when under the most pressure Keys 4-5 Gauff*Up 30-0, Gauff sends down a double to keep things close. But Keys, having hit a terrific approach on to the baseline, then nets her clean-up, and a succession of forehands secure the hold. Gauff is far more confident now, playing her natural game rather than one tailored to her opponent\u2019s strengths and weaknesses; she secures her hold and Keys will shortly serve to stay in a set she ought already to have won. The way she\u2019s playing, you fear for her. *Keys 4-4 GauffAnd Keys is feeling it, opening the game with a tame double, then losing a forehand to forehand rally \u2013 Gauff has found her range, taking the ball earlier and hitting a fuller length. Ahahaha, but of course as I type, Keys nails an inside-out winner \u2013 \u201cCall that a forehand,thisis a forehand\u201d \u2013 only to go long with it in the next rally, presenting two break-back points. Gosh, a second double means only one is required, and this is old Maddy back again, turning 4-1 40-15 into 4-4. A killer like Gauff is\u2019t likely to let her away with it. Keys 4-3 Gauff*Gauff is struggling to keep Keys\u2019 forehand out of things \u2013 points are being decided according to whether it hits or misses. And at 30-all, she finds a good return \u2026 but Gauff wears it well, taking control of the point and winning it in short order, then a netted forehand secures an important hold. The world no 2 is playing more positively now, looking to be proactive rather than reactive, and there\u2019s pressure on Keys as she prepares to defend her remaining break. *Keys 4-2 GauffGauff\u2019s forehand will always be a weakness but it\u2019s giving her almost nothing today; another error means 15-0, and she\u2019s hitting so many more unforceds than winners that it\u2019s almost impossible for her to win games. Keys, on the other hand, has settled. She believes in her game now, so isn\u2019t discouraged by adversity \u2013 though, as I type, a second serve sits up and begs to be punished; Gauff doesn\u2019t miss out, making 40-30, and we\u2019re soon at deuce. If she can prolong the rallies, testing Keys\u2019 patience, she\u2019s got a good chance, and when she makes advantage, she\u2019s offered a second serve to attack. And, though, she can\u2019t unleash a definitive return, Gauff plays a fine point, her forehand finally giving her something, she finishes the game with an overhead, and might Keys regret the three consecutive errors 40-15 into a first break back? We shall see, but even if it\u2019s too late for this set, we can hope that both players are now relaxing into things. Keys 4-1 Gauff*Keys is warming up here, moving Gauff laterally to open up space for the winner; 0-15. And when a double follows, then a netted forehand, you fear for the world no 2, who just hasn\u2019t got going yet; shonuff a second double of the game means Keys has the double break and the first set is almost hers. *Keys 3-1 GauffGauff again strides to the net and this time despatches a forehand winner for 0-15; we wind up at 30-all before a miserable forehand into the net hands Keys a point for a consolidation. Naturally, she serves to the forehand, Gauff\u2019s weaker wing, the return is netted and control of the set duly ceded. Keys 2-1 Gauff*A double gives Keys 0-15, but another forehand error, this time into the net, restores parity. And though she makes 15-30, two more forehands fall long \u2013 in comms, Chrissy reckons she\u2019s not putting enough top-spin on the ball \u2013 giving Gauff game-point. Oh, but have a look! Two forehand winners and Keys has advantage, Gauff marches in to slap a backhand into the net, and that\u2019s a third break in three games. The tension is palpable. Keys 1-0 Gauff*Gauff makes 15-30 then sticks in the next point until the error arrives \u2013 that\u2019s what we said at the start about making Keys hit a lot of balls. And looking to force the issue next rally, Keys goes for too much, overhitting an attempted forehand winner to return the break immediately. Neither player has settled yet. Keys 1-0 Gauff* (*denotes server)It\u2019s a shame and maybe even a scandal that Chatrier is so sparsely populated for so big a match. And its first point tells us plenty about how it might go, a long rally ending when Keys \u2013 my pick, if you\u2019re pushing me \u2013 hits a forehand into the top of the net. But a forehand winner soon gives her 15-3o, Gauff then goes long to hand over break point, and a further error, a netted forehand, gives Keys an early advantage. Righto, we\u2019re good to go;Gauff to serve. We\u2019ve been talking about psychological axioms but allow me ignore the one that says we should live in the moment:imagine the atmosphere on Chatrier a couple of hours for now, when Boisson and Andreeva come out Oooh yeah! The roof is closed.That will, I think, help Keys, whose big shots benefit from the certainty of stillness \u2013 she can whack it without worrying about wind and so on. Gauff, though, has plenty of her own power, and if she can hide her forehand is favourite. Salut \u00e0 tout le monde et bienvenue \u00e0 Roland-Garros 2025 \u2013 11\u00e8me jour! And what a start awaits us. Madison Keys is the Australian Open champion \u2013 gratuitous, but I\u2019ll never tire of typing that \u2013 finally realising the talent it was impossible to deny. Technically speaking, little has changed, but mentally she\u2019s a different person, making peace with the career she\u2019s had in order to grow into the player she now is. Or, put another way, she\u2019s a lesson in the value of psychological axioms: self-worth comes from within, not without; we are defined by what is in our head and our hearts, not according to our professional accomplishments. But this morning, she faces an opponent able to examine both her game and her equilibrium.Coco Gauffis a grand slam champion in her own right, a phenomenal athlete who\u2019ll ask her to hit a lot of balls \u2013 a test as mental as it is technical and facilitated by a damp, cold day. Though it\u2019s easy to plot a path to victory for both players, it\u2019s far harder to decide which of them will be celebrating at the end. Following them on to court, we\u2019ve Mirra Andreeva, a talent so natural she might\u2019ve been playing in the womb. But Lois Boisson is in ridiculous form, in the process of announcing herself to the tennis world; she absolutely believes and, as Maddy could tell you, that\u2019s a large chunk of the battle. And finally for the day session, we\u2019veJannik Sinner, the best player in the world, against Sascha Bublik, a mercurial maverick who might finally have reconciled his power and hands with what it takes to succeed as a professional. We think we know who\u2019ll win, but then we thought the same when he was two sets down to Alex de Minaur, just as we did before he met Jack Draper in the last round. If he\u2019s got another performance left in him, we\u2019re in for a treat. On y va! Play: 11asm local, 10am BST",

Kyrgios has not played atWimbledonsince losing the 2022 final to Novak Djokovic, after a combination of knee, foot and wrist injuries. He had hoped to play doubles at the French Open with Jordan Thompsonbut withdrewfrom what would have been his first appearance at Roland Garros since 2017 with a knee injury. On Tuesday, Kyrgios confirmed that problem would also rule him out of Wimbledon. \u201cJust wanted to give everyone a quick update \u2013 l\u2019ve hit a small setback in my recovery and unfortunately won\u2019t make it back for grass season this year,\u201d Kyrgios wrote on Instagram. \u201cI know how much you\u2019ve all been looking forward to seeing me out there, and I\u2019m genuinely sorry to disappoint. This is just a bump in the road though, and I\u2019m already working hard to get back stronger than ever. \u201cThank you for all your continued support \u2013 it means everything to me. See you soon!\u201d Now 30, Kyrgios faces an uphill battle to resurrect his career, which has been hammered by injuries since late 2022. The former world No 13 has played only four singles matches this year, claiming his first tour victory in two-and-a-half years at the Miami Open in March. His Wimbledon withdrawal means his first-round exit at this year\u2019s Australian Open will remain his only grand slam appearance \u2013 of a possible 11 \u2013 since the start of 2023.

        "raw_text": "It starts with a sore toe, difficulty tying a shoelace, a tingle in a finger. Author Joe Hammond found himself \u201clike a passenger in the aisle of a plane going through gentle turbulence\u201d. For Ross Lyon\u2019s mum, Louise, it started with a twitch in her calf muscle. Within a few months, she couldn\u2019t move her arms or legs. Within a year, it was in her throat, and she was unable to breathe. For Don Pyke\u2019s father, Frank, it started with difficulty swallowing. He was a professor and a sports scientist and a member of the Sport Australia Hall of Fame. In the early 1970s, he played a key role in rehabilitating Dennis Lillee\u2019s back. Motor neurone disease (MND) killed him in 16 weeks. For Neale Daniher, it started in his hands. He found it hard to peg his shirts on the clothesline. He fumbled with his car keys. A friend noticed his handshake had weakened. Daniher calls it \u201cthe beast\u201d but doctors, researchers, patients and carers around the world call it \u201cthe bastard\u201d. Every day in Australia, two people are diagnosed and two people die. Prof Brad Turner of the Florey Institute says it\u2019s \u201cthe most incapacitating disease of our species\u201d. The Danihers are farming people from the baking red dirt of the Riverina. Neale and his 10 brothers and sisters quickly learned there was no room for sentimentality and self-pity. On the farm, you planned for the worst. You never complained. You worked hard. You got on with it. You learned that so much in this world is beyond your control. Neale was the only Daniher sent away to boarding school. He didn\u2019t want to be a farmer. He was too curious, too introspective, too restless for that life. He studied theology for a year at the University of Melbourne. He was coached by Ray Carroll at Assumption College and Kevin Sheedy at Essendon, and his own coaching tenure melded their ferocity and cunning. Many of his former players were amazed at the wise-cracking man who emerged later in life. Having been kept at arms-length during their playing careers, so many of them have built enduring, meaningful relationships with the man they once feared, and now adore. It\u2019s more than a dozen years since Daniher was diagnosed with MND. It\u2019s a decade since the inaugural Big Freeze match. So much has changed in that time. The queen\u2019s birthday is now the king\u2019s birthday. Both Melbourne and Collingwood have cycled between ineptitude and success. Daniher, initially given 27 months at best, has walked two daughters down the aisle, welcomed grandchildren, and been named Australian of the Year. He now uses gaze interaction technology to communicate, utilising his voice from old press conferences. After being woefully underfunded for so long, there\u2019s better understanding of MND, there\u2019s groundbreaking research, and there\u2019s cautious optimism that this thing can eventually be beaten. Initiatives such as the Big Freeze could easily drown in cliche. It could get drawn into tired analogies of sport and death. Football could easily strain to mean more than it does. That was never going to happen with Daniher. He hates it when people call him a hero. He doesn\u2019t want pity. He wants a cure. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dying,\u201d Daniher wrote in his book, \u201ceveryone thinks you\u2019re a great bloke. When I was footballer, they had me in the \u2018natural born leader\u2019 box and then the \u2018unfulfilled talent\u2019 box. As a coach they put me in the \u2018intense bastard\u2019 box and now that I have a terminal illness I\u2019m in the \u2018such an inspiration\u2019 box.\u201d Sign up toFrom the Pocket: AFL Weekly Jonathan Horn brings expert analysis on the week's biggest AFL stories after newsletter promotion Reading that, I think of something The Sopranos creator, David Chase, said: \u201cWhatever the opposite of bullshit is, that\u2019s what I think Jim Gandolfini was searching for.\u201d In every utterance, every joke, every deflection, every dollar raised, that\u2019s Daniher \u2013 the complete absence of bullshit.

        "raw_text": "The road to North America lies through Western Australia, and the hope for the Socceroos is that it doesn\u2019t all go south against their rivals from East Asia. A win against Japan in Perth on Thursday would almost certainly be enough for coach Tony Popovic\u2019s side totake the second automatic spot in their 2026 World Cup qualifier group. The good news is that there has never been a better time to face a Samurai Blue side that hasalready qualifiedand is in experimental mode. The bad news is \u2026 well, that is for Saudi Arabia to deal with. Having dominated Group C \u2013 being the first to book a berth in the newly expanded 48-team tournament and boasting a goal difference of plus-46 in 14 qualifiers so far \u2013 Japan have earned the right to bring a squad containing just seven players with more than 10 international caps to Australia. They have also cemented their reputation as a genuine global force. After clinching their spot against Bahrain in March, captain Wataru Endo \u2013 one of the few established stars to make this trip \u2013 said that it was time to think about winning theWorld Cup. In 2005, the Japan Football Association pledged to do so by 2050. People laughed at the time, but to wait that long now would be a little disappointing. That was around the time whenAustraliajoined the AFC and now, the situation with the two teams is all but reversed. Japan are full of stars playing in the big leagues. Endo has just won the Premier League title with Liverpool, Kaoru Mitoma is reportedly wanted by Arsenal and Bayern Munich and is set to take the title of Asia\u2019s biggest star from Son Heung-min. Ao Tanaka of newly promoted Leeds United was, for many, the best player in the this season\u2019s Championship. Fans in Perth would usually love the rare chance to see such European-based talent but both Mitoma and Tanaka are absent. Indeed, many of Japan\u2019s European stars have been allowed by coach Hajime Moriyasu to go on holiday \u2013 including the likes of Ritsu Doan of SC Freiburg, Monaco\u2019s Takumi Minamino, Hidemasa Morita of Sporting, Borussia Monchengladbach\u2019s Ko Itakura. In total, just 13 of the 27 players who made March\u2019s squad will be in Perth. \u201cI have always tried to make changes,\u201d said Moriyasu, who has been in charge since 2018. \u201cIn my opinion, it is not so much that we are selecting them, but rather that they have been proving themselves with performances that are worthy of selection.\u201d Ryunosuke Sato, for example, is just 18 years old but has impressed as wing-back on loan at Fagiano Okayama. Junnosuke Suzuki, a 21-year-old converted centre-back also looks to have a bright future. Shunsuke Mito is another newbie, as is fellow Netherlands-based star Kodai Sano who joins his brother and FC Mainz player Kaishu. It is testament to the coach\u2019s leadership that while Japan are a settled and stable side with a firm identity, he has also selected over 60 players since the 2022 World Cup. Given what is at stake for the hosts, few in Australia will care if their opponents are not at their strongest. There are, however, concerns in Saudi Arabia, who are three points behind the Socceroos with a much inferior goal difference, and in need of a favour. There was an assumption in Riyadh that Japan would get at least a draw in Perth to ensure that Herv\u00e9 Renard\u2019s side would hold the top-two destiny in their own hands, with the shortest of trips to Bahrain followed by a home game against a travel-weary Socceroos five days later. After Moriyasu named his squad, confidence in Riyadh has taken a dent. The Chinese media have also discussed Moriyasu\u2019s choices as they are counting on the Blues to beat Indonesia, rivals for the top four, at home on Tuesday. Sign up toFootball Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion While Japan may still play Moriyasu\u2019s favoured 3-4-2-1 formation, given all the changes, it is hard to know who starts and who does not. Moriyasu said the rookies need some veterans around them. Endo should be in the middle, perhaps behind the more creative talents of Takefusa Kubo, who had a good season with Real Sociedad and Daichi Kamada who helped Crystal Palace win the FA Cup. Left-back Y\u016bto Nagatomo, provider of the decisive cross for the 2011 Asian Cup\u2019s winning goal, may inch closer to his 150th cap, not much fewer than the other 26 have between them. There may be some issues for the Australian coaching staff to try and prepare for a game against a potentially unfamiliar foe but this has to be better than facing the strongest version of Japan desperate for points. That there is still plenty of talent does not need to be said, the same with warnings against complacency \u2013 the new players have a chance to play themselves into contention for the World Cup \u2013 but there is no doubt that Japan are in Perth with more than one eye on the next northern summer.",

        "raw_text": "Australia\u2019s rapid recovery under Tony Popovic in qualification for the 2026 World Cup has left the Socceroos on the cusp of a place in North America with two group games to play, and a direct berth could be secured as early as Friday morning. But the result of the Socceroos\u2019 match on Thursday in Perth against Japan \u2013 group leaders and already qualified \u2013 cannot alone guarantee the qualification fate of Australia, currently lying behind the Samurai Blue in second place. Instead, the group\u2019s other automatic qualification slot will be determined by the performances of third-placed Saudi Arabia in their two remaining matches \u2013 first away to Bahrain then on Tuesday in Jeddah against the Socceroos \u2013 and fourth-placed Indonesia who need two victories and a miracle. Saudi Arabia are Australia\u2019s main rivals, trailing by just three points, but with a goal difference of -2 compared to the Socceroos\u2019 +7. It means if Australia avoid defeat against the Green Falcons next week, they are almost guaranteed second place. And if they do something they haven\u2019t done in 16 years on Thursday \u2013 beat the Samurai Blue, who have sent a squad missing several key players \u2013 it will be time for Socceroos fans to start checking flights to Mexico, the US and Canada. The players are aware of the odd qualification situation, and the strange dynamic whereby \u2013 even if they win on Thursday \u2013 they won\u2019t be able to fully celebrate after the game. \u201cIf we do get the win, hopefully, which we will, we are obviously almost there,\u201d defender Milos Degenek said on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see how Bahrain play with Saudi, obviously.\u201d That game in Riffa kicks off at 2am AEST. The permutations are largely positive for the Socceroos, but just last year they looked precarious. A shock home loss to Bahrain and draw with Indonesia triggered the departure of former coach Graham Arnold, who had taken the Socceroos to the round of 16 in Qatar and a gallant defeat to eventual winners Argentina. Popovic won his first match against China, is yet to taste defeat, and appears to have earned the trust of the players. \u201cThe way we see the national team is completely different to what it was before,\u201d Degenek said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much pride and there\u2019s so much, I guess, love for the shirt and the culture that the boss has brought in here.\u201d The team has benefited from the new qualifying format for the 48-team tournament to be held in the US, Canada and Mexico, an increase of 16 teams compared to Qatar and an extra three slots for the Asian Football Confederation. Even if the Socceroos let slip their automatic qualification opportunity in coming days, there is a fourth round and, failing that, a playoff phase. \u201cNow that there\u2019s more countries at the World Cup, there\u2019s a \u2013 if you don\u2019t qualify through this group stage \u2013 another group stage, and you get through that group stage is another playoff game. So there\u2019s another almost a year of football if you don\u2019t qualify directly,\u201d Degenek said. \u201cSo hopefully we\u2019ll do the job to on Thursday, and hopefully Bahrain can do a job for us as well.\u201d Sign up toFootball Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion Failure to qualify for the 48-team tournament would be damning for this generation of players, coaches and administrators. But the Socceroos, ranked 26 by Fifa, are trying not to look beyond Thursday\u2019s showdown. They have not beaten Japan since 2009, and have done so only twice this century. The first was the famous 3-1 comeback inspired by Tim Cahill in the 2006 World Cup. Three years later he scored twice again in a 2-1 victory at the MCG. Since then it has been 10 matches without an Australian victory, including a defeat in the 2011 Asian Cup final and five losses in six matches between 2013 and 2022. That run was ended by the stoic display in Saitama in October, when the Socceroos came away with a 1-1 draw. That result, and a draw with Saudi Arabia three months ago, are the only matches in which the Samurai Blue have dropped points this phase, which has consolidated their place as Asia\u2019s leading power. The side ranked 15 in the world could afford to leave out European stars including Brighton\u2019s Kaoru Mitoma, Ao Tanaka of Leeds, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s Ko Itakura, Feyenoord\u2019s Ayase Ueda and Sporting\u2019s Hidemasa Morita from the squad for Thursday\u2019s match, which includes seven first-time call-ups. Degenek challenged the notion that this would make Japan any less formidable, warning the new and fringe players will be motivated to earn their place in the squad for the World Cup. \u201cIt\u2019s even harder for us that those so-called stars are out, because the boys that are coming in, whether they\u2019re from the J-League or other clubs in Europe, are going to want to prove to the boss that they should be there at the World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not going to be a walk in the park.\u201d",

        "raw_text": "Lorenzo Musetti admitted that he was \u201cscared\u201d about potentially being defaulted after accidentally kicking a tennis ball at a line judge during his win over Frances Tiafoe in the quarter-finals of theFrench Open. On Tuesday, the eighth seed Musetti held his nerve in treacherous windy conditions to close out a stellar 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 win over the 15th seed Tiafoe and reach the semi-finals in Paris for the first time. The match, however, included a moment of jeopardy after he kicked a ball towards the back fence. It rebounded against the shoulder of an unflinching line judge. Musetti received a code violation warning for unsportsmanlike conduct. \u201cHonestly it was really unlucky coincidence,\u201d said Musetti. \u201cI was a little bit, honestly, scared, because I really didn\u2019t want to harm nobody, of course. So I immediately went to the line umpire, and I of course said sorry. I apologise to everyone. It was right to have a warning, but I think the umpire saw that there was no intention about that, and that\u2019s why he probably just let me continue my game.\u201d Afterwards, Tiafoe described the ruling as \u201ccomical\u201d and suggested that there are inconsistencies within the rules. There have been numerous examples of players being defaulted over the years for unintentionally hitting people with a tennis ball. Two years ago in Paris, the Japanese player Miyu Kato was disqualified from the women\u2019s doubles tournament, along with her partner Aldila Sutjiadi, after unintentionally hitting a ballgirl. \u201cObviously he did that and nothing happened,\u201d said Tiafoe. \u201cI think that\u2019s comical, but it is what it is. Nothing happened, so there\u2019s nothing really to talk about. Obviously it\u2019s not consistent, so it is what it is.\u201d On the court, Musetti continues to enjoy a breakout run this year. After a career best 2024 season in which he reached the semi-finals of Wimbledon and won a singles bronze medal at the Paris Olympics, the 23-year-old Italian has taken another massive leap forward during this clay court season. He followed up his first Masters 1000 final in Monte Carlo by reaching the semi-finals in the Madrid Open, Italian Open and now at the French Open. He is just the fifth player since the ATP was formed in 1990 to reach the semi-finals or better at all three clay Masters 1000 events and the French Open in one year. Having accrued so many points in recent weeks, Musetti will rise from No 16 at the beginning of the clay court season to at least No 7 in the ATP rankings and he sits at No 5 in the live rankings. He could leapfrog Jack Draper to No 4 in the live rankings with a win. Musetti will rekindle his rivalry withCarlos Alcaraz, the defending champion, in the semi-finals after the Spaniard found his best level at last during his 6-0, 6-1, 6-4 demolition of Tommy Paul. Alcaraz has now reached the semi-finals at Roland Garros for the last three years. Alcaraz had endured a complicated path to the quarter-finals, dropping a set in three of his four matches as his patience occasionally waned. Considering his wavering level, a quarter-final meeting with Paul was potentially dangerous. Paul is one of the best athletes on tour, behind Alcaraz himself, and he has made life hell for the Spaniard in the past with his own ability to seamlessly straddle defence and attack, as Alcaraz can. But Alcaraz appeared to have the ball on a string in the early stages of the match. He tore through the first set with a demonstration of spectacular, varied shotmaking and kept on going: \u201cI could close my eyes and everything went in,\u201d said Alcaraz. \u201cMy feelings today were unbelievable. I was starting to give every shot at my 100%.\u201d While Alcaraz performed at an incredible level throughout, Paul understandably looked weary from early on. The American had been struggling with an abdominal issue from early in the tournament but he came through consecutive five set matches in the second and third rounds en route to the quarter-finals. Even in perfect health, however, he may not have had any response against a special, singular talent in full flow.",

        "raw_text": "Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek will take their era-defining rivalry to the latter stages of the French Open for the first time as they reached the semi-finals. Sabalenka, the world No 1, edged past Zheng Qinwen, the eighth seed, 7-6 (3), 6-3 to end the Olympic gold medalist\u2019s 10-match winning streak at Roland Garros. Sabalenka has reached the last four in nine of her past 10 grand slam tournaments, her only earlier loss coming in the quarter-finals in Paris last year when she was suffering from food poisoning. Shortly after a satisfied Sabalenka departed Court Philippe-Chatrier, the fifth seed Swiatek returned to her favourite court and closed out a deceptively difficult 6-1, 7-5 win over Elina Svitolina to maintain her remarkable streak in Paris. Swiatek has now won 26 consecutive matches at theFrench Openand stands just two victories away from becoming the first woman in the Open era to win the French Open four years in succession. Thursday will mark a 13th battle between Sabalenka, a three-time grand slam champion, and Swiatek, who has won five. Swiatek leads the head-to-head 8-4 and the match-up has produced some memorable contests including an unforgettable 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (7) win for Swiatek in last year\u2019s Madrid Open final. However, their only previous meeting at a grand slam came in 2022 when Swiatek defeated Sabalenka in the semi-final of the US Open. \u201cBefore it wasn\u2019t any communication, any practices with her, but now we are getting better. We get along better, and we practice more often, and we know each other quite well,\u201d said Sabalenka. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of great battles in the past. I\u2019m super excited and it\u2019s high-level matches. I\u2019m super excited to go out there and to fight and to do everything I need to get the win.\u201d On a difficult, windy afternoon in Paris, Sabalenka had a score to settle against Zheng, who finally defeated her for the first time in seven attempts at the Italian Open three weeks ago. As she has positioned herself at the top of the sport, Sabalenka\u2019s mental toughness and composure has become one of her most important assets. Despite trailing by a break for much of the first set, she methodically worked her way back into the match before taking control with an authoritative tie-break. Having started this tournament searching for confidence and self-belief after a difficult run of form, Swiatek\u2019s fourth-round victory over Elena Rybakinaafter trailing 1-6, 0-2has clearly boosted her confidence. On Tuesday, an unusually aggressive Svitolina made life difficult for Swiatek in their numerous attritional service games but Swiatek remained sharp and focused on the key points. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she elevates my game,\u201d said Swiatek on Sabalenka. \u201cAgainst every player, we play a different way, so it\u2019s hard to compare. But for sure our rivalry is pushing both of us, I think, but it\u2019s not only about the level of tennis. It\u2019s about like everything, how we work, and how professional we are. So I can say that for sure.\u201d With the two most successful players of the past few years in action, Tuesday\u2019s lineup also drew further attention to the tournament\u2019s controversial scheduling decisions. In addition to the Roland Garros organisers refusing to schedule any women\u2019s clash as the feature evening match on Chatrier each day, a women\u2019s match has been pencilled in as the first event on Chatrier every day of the week, a time when Parisian crowds tend to be more interested in preparing for lunch than watching tennis. \u201cI definitely have to say that we deserve equal treatment,\u201d said Sabalenka. \u201cThere were a lot of great battles, a lot of great matches, which would be cool to see as night session [matches], just more people in the stands watching these incredible battles. And just to show ourselves to more people. I definitely agree that we deserve to be put in a bigger stage, like better timing, more people watching.\u201d",

Respondingto questionsabout the incident from an Italian journalist, Toto Wolff, the Mercedes F1 principal, said: \u201cThis is road rage, like the taxi drivers in Rome or Naples.\u201d The journalist tried to defend his country\u2019s drivers, saying: \u201cWe have improved a lot inItaly.\u201d Wolff said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of aggression in the centre of Rome and Naples, without rules.\u201d While the remarks appear to have been shrugged off by taxi drivers in Naples, their counterparts in Rome, who in recent years have had to contend with wayward electric scooter riders, omnipresent construction sites and tourists being shown around in golf buggies, were outraged. \u201cMaybe it would be better if Wolff focused on [the performance] of his own team,\u201d Loreno Bittarelli, president of Rome\u2019s largest taxi cooperative, toldCorriere della Seranewspaper. Nicola Di Giacobbe, from the taxi union, Filt-Cgil, joked: \u201cWe drive like a Mercedes since it only goes 30 miles an hour, just like us.\u201d However, Di Giacobbe conceded that Rome has serious problems when it comes to traffic congestion and rule-flouting, making mobility in the city \u201ca no man\u2019s land\u201d. Roberto, a taxi driver with 40 years\u2019 experience, told Corriere: \u201cWe are the best at driving in the chaotic traffic of this city. We are more patient and expert than the average driver. This city has gotten worse in recent years \u2013 now it takes 30 minutes to go two kilometres.\u201d Fellow tax driver, Alessandro, referred to Wolff\u2019s comments as \u201ca banal cliche\u201d. \u201cWe are the ones who are first in not having accidents, otherwise we would lose our working day,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to seeFormula Onedrivers manoeuvring around construction sites, scooters and golf carts the way we do. Rome is now a jungle, not a Formula One track.\u201d",

        "raw_text": "Max Verstappen has admitted that his crash into George Russell\u2019s Mercedesin the Spanish Grand Prixwas \u201cnot right and should not have happened\u201d, after he faced a swathe of criticism over his initial bullish response to the incident. The former world champion Nico Rosberg said Verstappen should have been disqualified and Russell, who said he believed the move was \u00addeliberate, was unequivocal that if it were the casethe world champion should have been disqualified. After the race on Sunday, Verstap\u00adpen answered questions about his intent with the dismissive reply: \u201cDoes it \u00admatter?\u201d, and responded to \u00adRussell\u2019s criticism by suggesting sarcastically that the Briton might need a tissue for his tears. But a day later,\u00adVerstappen took a somewhat more conciliatory toneon social media. In a post he said: \u201cWe had an exciting strategy and good race in Barcelona, till the safety car came out. Our tyre choice to the end and some moves after the safety car restart fuelled my frustration, \u00adleading to a move that was not right and shouldn\u2019t have happened. \u201cI always give every\u00adthing out there for the team and emotions can run high. You win some together, you lose some together. See you [at the next race] in Montreal.\u201d Verstappen had found himself stymied on the wrong tyres after a late safety car in Barcelona and with what he admitted was frustration at the sequence of events, including \u00adlosing places and concluding with him having to cede a place to \u00adRussell, he moved over for Russell and then accelerated back up the inside to strike the side of the Mercedes. He was given a 10-second penalty for causing a collision, which the stewards deemed had \u201c\u00adundoubtedly\u201d been caused by his actions. He was also penalised with three points on his racing licence, moving him to 11. One more point at the next two races, in Canada or Austria, will result in an immediate one-race ban. His on-track penalty dropped him to 10th place and he has fallen to 49\u00a0points behind the drivers\u2019 championship leader, Oscar Piastri. Responses from other drivers were generally guarded as they wanted to see what had happened in more detail but McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris did compare Verstappen\u2019s move as something he might try in Mario Kart. They are likely to be more forthcoming at the next round in Montreal, where the incident will undoubtedly be discussed at the drivers\u2019 briefing. Rosberg, on Sky Sports, was clear he felt it was unacceptable. \u201cIt looked like a very intentional retaliation,\u201d he said. \u201cWait for the opponent, go ramming into him, just like you felt the other guy rammed into you at turn one. That\u2019s something which is extremely unacceptable and I think the rules would be a black flag.\u201d Sign up toThe Recap The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend\u2019s action after newsletter promotion The stewards investigated the incident immediately and issued the penalty at the time, so the four-time world champion will not receive any further sanction. The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, argued that it reflected Verstappen\u2019s character. \u201cThe great ones, whether it\u2019s in motor racing or in other sports, you just need to have the world against you and perform at the highest possible level,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cThat\u2019s why sometimes these greats don\u2019t recognise that actually the world is not against you, it\u2019s just you who has made a mistake or screwed up.\u201d During the early part of his career Verstappen was noted as being impetuous and overly aggressive but he has since developed into a more rounded driver. His dominant title wins in 2022 and 2023 were secured with an assured calm. However, Verstappen has proved more volatile when pushed to the limit \u2013 as he was in 2021 by Lewis \u00adHamilton, and during this season where he is \u00adfighting a far superior McLaren car.",

Bengaluru posted a modest 190 for nine with Kohli, their leading scorer this season, top scoring for them with a composed 43. It was, however, their bowling which secured their win after they restricted Punjab to 184 for seven despite Shashank Singh\u2019s unbeaten 61 off 30 balls. Kohli was in tears once he realised Bengaluru were about to shed the underachiever tag that has stuck to them. \u201cThis win is as much for the fans as it is for the team. It has been 18 long years,\u201d said Kohli, who has been associated with Bengaluru since the inaugural edition of theIPLin 2008. \u201cI have given my youth, my prime. I gave it everything I have \u2013 I never thought this day would come. I was overcome with emotion as soon as the last ball was bowled.\u201d Put in to bat at a packed Narendra Modi Stadium, Bengaluru could not stitch together significant partnerships and fell short of the 200 mark. Kohli anchored their innings but Bengaluru could never really break loose. Bengaluru were 87 for two at the midway stage but with enough overs left for other players to bat around Kohli. Azmatullah Omarzai deceived Kohli with a bouncer and took a running, tumbling return catch to dismiss the batter. Jitesh Sharma\u2019s 24 off 10 balls injected some momentum into Bengaluru\u2019s stop-start innings and Liam Livingstone made 25 but the side could not really capitalise in the final overs. Punjab\u2019s Kyle Jamieson took three for 48, while his new ball partner, Arshdeep Singh, bowled an excellent three-wicket final over, conceding only three runs. Punjab got off to a rollicking start in their chase and the opener Prabhsimran Singh, then on nine, was lucky to be spilled in the deep by Romario Shepherd. Josh Hazlewood, the luckless Bengaluru bowler, did not have to wait long for success though, as Phil Salt took a stunning catch in the deep to remove Priyansh Arya (24) and break the 43-run opening stand.

        "raw_text": "Swimmers, coaches and officials who compete in or support a controversial new sports event allowing performance-enhancing drugs will be barred from elite competition, World Aquatics announced on Tuesday. The move targets theEnhanced Games, a privately funded, Olympics-style event set to debut in Las Vegas next May, which explicitly permits \u2013 and encourages \u2013 the use of substances banned under global anti-doping rules. Athletes will not be drug-tested and may follow personalized pharmaceutical regimens, provided they disclose their use to organizers. World Aquatics said anyone who \u201csupports, endorses, or participates in sporting events that embrace the use of scientific advancements or other practices that may include prohibited substances and/or prohibited methods\u201d will be ineligible for the organization\u2019s events. This includes athletes, coaches, administrators, and medical personnel. \u201cThose who enable doped sport are not welcome at World Aquatics or our events,\u201d said Husain al-Musallam, the organization\u2019s president. The Enhanced Games, slated for 21\u201324 May 2026 in Las Vegas, will feature sprinting, swimming and weightlifting. Organizers have promised prize money of up to $500,000 per event, including $1m bonuses for breaking world records in the 100m sprint or 50m freestyle. Australian swimmer and three-time Olympic medalist James Magnussen is among a small group of athletes who have publicly signed on. The event\u2019s founder, Australian entrepreneur Aron D\u2019Souza, has pitched the Games as a revolutionary platform embracing what he calls \u201csuperhumanity\u201d, a future where pharmaceutical and technological enhancement is normalized. Athletes may compete naturally, follow enhancement protocols, or participate in clinical trials using FDA-designated \u201cInvestigational Medicinal Products\u201d. \u201cWe are creating a new category of human excellence,\u201d promotional materials say. \u201cA world where performance-enhancing drugs are used safely, openly, and under medical supervision.\u201d D\u2019Souza has called anti-doping policy \u201coutdated and hypocritical\u201d, claiming the Enhanced Games offers a safer, more transparent alternative. The plan has drawn sharp criticism from anti-doping bodies and sports federations. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous clown show, not real sport,\u201d said Travis Tygart, head of the US Anti-Doping Agency. The World Anti-Doping Agency warned the project \u201cjeopardizes athletes\u2019 health and well-being\u201d by promoting \u201cthe abuse of powerful substances and methods that should only be prescribed, if at all, for specific therapeutic needs\u201d. Athletes are expected to undergo medical screening and be monitored by independent health and ethics boards. But enforcement appears largely voluntary, a feature organizers describe as part of their \u201cpartnership-first\u201d model. In February, Greek-Bulgarian swimmer Kristian Gkolomeev reportedly swam faster than the world record in the 50m freestyle while on an enhancement protocol. Though organizers touted the result, it came with caveats: Gkolomeev wore a full-body polyurethane suit not approved by World Aquatics, and the swim is not recognized as official. Financial backing for the Games includes support from figures aligned with former U.S. president Donald Trump. A recent investment round was led by 1789 Capital, a firm co-founded byDonald Trump Jr. Other backers include Peter Thiel\u2019s Apeiron Investment Group and the hedge fund Karatage. D\u2019Souza has welcomed the association with Trump-linked donors, calling it \u201cmore important than any investment\u201d to have political and cultural backing from prominent American conservatives. World Aquatics\u2019 announcement comes amid efforts to clamp down on the Enhanced Games before they gain further traction. No major broadcasters or sponsors have been confirmed, and the pool of committed athletes remains small. Still, organizers say they are pressing forward with plans for a year-round training base and a broader business venture selling personalized enhancement programs to consumers. While the Enhanced Games bills itself as a parallel to the Olympics, critics say it risks undermining global sport entirely. \u201cThe greater risk,\u201d reads an internal Enhanced FAQ, \u201cis pretending those risks don\u2019t exist.\u201d Whether the public embraces or rejects that philosophy may determine if the Enhanced Games are a one-off experiment or a disruptive force in the future of elite competition.",

        "raw_text": "Jim Chalmers says making cigarettes cheaper will not solve the booming trade in illegal tobacco, dismissing the call by theNew South Walespremier, Chris Minns, to slash taxes on smoking. Minns joined Victoria\u2019s state government in blaming the high tobacco excise for a spike in organised crime that has led to arson attacks on businesses and stretched police resources. The NSW premier said his state will propose a cut to the federal excise to deter illegal tobacco sales at the next health ministers\u2019 meeting later this month, even as he admitted that it was \u201cprobably not a popular thing for a premier to say\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s been a tax on cigarettes for decades, and I understand that,\u201d he said. But he said the excise had \u201cradically increased\u201d over the past five years and the high taxes were causing people who would never usually break the law to buy illegal tobacco. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t break the law in a million years, but they\u2019re being dragged into a black market where they go to the store, they can either buy a $17 or $20 packet of illegal cigarettes, or a $60 packet of cigarettes.\u201d The excise accounts for three-quarters of the price of a packet of cigarettes, making them among the most expensive in the world. On Wednesday, Chalmers joined the federal health minister, Mark Butler, in rejecting the view that cheaper cigarettes would solve the growing black market for tobacco. \u201cI don\u2019t think the answer here is to make cigarettes cheaper for people,\u201d the treasurer said. \u201cI think the answer here is to get better at compliance. And the [federal government] has to come to the table \u2026 with hundreds of millions of dollars in new funding to try and combat the scourge of illegal tobacco.\u201d \u201cIt is a substantial public health challenge still in our economy. It\u2019s also a law and order challenge, and we\u2019re addressing both of those things simultaneously.\u201d Butler said overseas evidence showed there was no clear link between lower prices and less crime. \u201cPrice has an impact, but if you look at other countries that have substantially lower priced cigarettes than Australia \u2013 the US, some European countries, most in Asia as well \u2013 they also have thriving black markets,\u201d Butler said. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion \u201cBecause organised criminal gangs, no matter where they are, no matter what the price of legal cigarettes, recognise that black market cigarettes are a very easy way for them to make money. And the only way to stop that is to enforce good laws against bad people.\u201d But Victoria\u2019s minister for casino, gaming and liquor regulation, Enver Erdogan, said the high price of legal cigarettes was one of \u201cmultiple factors\u201d driving the growth of the illicit trade, which has sparked a turf war in the statethat has seen more than 100 businesses firebombed. \u201cThe price differential between the legal and illicit product is large. Accepting that tobacco is an addiction, and so for many people they\u2019re going for the cheaper product, I think we do need a national approach,\u201d Erdogan said. National figures released on Wednesday revealed a drop of almost 16% in spending on tobacco products in the year to March, which Chalmers said reflected both the increase in illegal trade as well as more Australians quitting smoking. \u201cWe have to resist the temptation to think it\u2019s either 100% people giving away the darts, or 100% illegal activity,\u201d the treasurer said. \u201cIt\u2019s both of those things. One of those developments is very good. One of those developments is very challenging. We\u2019re not ignoring it.\u201d The most recent budget committed an additional $157m to fight the illegal tobacco trade, which was on top of the $188.5m over four years to border enforcement. Tobacco excise revenues are expected to drop from $9.7bn in 2023-24 to $6.7bn in 2028-29, according to the budget papers.",

        "raw_text": "The Fair Work Commission says a 3.5% above-inflation increase to the minimum wage was necessary to avoid \u201centrenched\u201d lower living standards among the millions of Australia\u2019s lowest-paid workers. The president of the FWC, Justice Adam Hatcher, said the decision would help claw back the loss of real incomes over the past few years, even as employer groups warned many smaller businesses would struggle the afford the \u201cgenerous\u201d pay rise. The new minimum wage from July will be $24.95 an hour, or $948 per week, up from $24.10 and $915.90, respectively \u2013 a weekly increase of about $32. Anthony Albanese noted the decision was about 1 percentage point higher than the current rate of inflation, saying the result \u201cwill be welcomed by people who keep our economy going, the essential workers who need this wage increase in real terms\u201d. Nearly 3 million employees, or one in five, have their pay set by an award and will be directly affected by the annual minimum wage determination. Affected workers are concentrated in labour-intensive and female-dominated industries such as hospitality, health and social assistance, and administrative services. The number of Australians paid the minimum wage, however, is a fraction of that - below 100,000 people, according to government estimates. The annual determination delivered on Tuesday morning was quickly welcomed by the peak unions body, but was criticised by business groups who had argued for an increase of 2-2.5%. The Reserve Bank recently projected inflation will climb from 2.4% in the year to March, to 3.1% by mid-2026 following the end of government cost of living measures, such as energy subsidies. Hatcher said the \u201cinflation spike\u201d had particularly hurt lower-paid workers, and that fears of further fueling inflation had informed minimum wage decisions in recent years. But with inflation back under control, Hatcher said it was time to make up for that hit to living standards, adding that \u201cwe are satisfied that the level of wage increase we have determined is sustainable\u201d. \u201cThe principal consideration which has guided our decision is the fact that since July 2021, employees who are reliant upon modern award minimum wages, or the national minimum wage, have suffered a reduction in the real value of their wage rates,\u201d he said when handing down the decision. \u201cThis provides us with an opportunity to go at least some of the way towards correcting what has happened over the last four years by awarding a real increase to modern award wages and the national minimum wage.\u201d \u201cWe are concerned that if this opportunity is not taken in this annual wage review, a loss in the real value of wages which has occurred will become permanently embedded in the modern award system and the national minimum wage, and a reduction of living standards for the lowest paid in the community will thereby be entrenched.\u201d The RBA governor, Michele Bullock, has said the bank anticipates inflation will settle at around the middle of the 2-3% target range over the coming two years. ACTU secretary Sally McManus credited union pressure and the Albanese government\u2019s advocacy for the real minimum wage rise. \u201cThis wage increase means those who are paid award wages will start to get ahead again, easing pressure on their weekly budgets and part of the stress that comes from having to cut back on the basics,\u201d McManus said in a statement. The government had argued in favour of a decision that did not send workers\u2019 wages backwards, and the final result falls between the competing demands from the peak union body and business groups. The chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Andrew McKellar, said \u201cwe think this increase is a generous increase for employees\u201d and that \u201cthis decision is being delivered against a backdrop of declining productivity\u201d. Business groups such as ACCI had made the case for an increase of around 2.5% or lower, arguing that firms were struggling with sharp increases in operating costs. Economists said the minimum pay rise would not prevent the RBA from delivering further rate cuts this year, although RBC Capital chief economist Su-Lin Ong said the increase \u201cerrs a little high from an economic and sustainability lens\u201d. The FWC, in its ruling, said Australia\u2019s ongoing poor productivity performance had \u201crestrained\u201d the size of minimum pay rises. \u201cCertainly, the productivity problem will not be resolved by the indefinite continuation of the reduction in real wages which has occurred over the last four years,\u201d it said.

The minister for emergency management, Kristy McBain, said it planned to fund projects designed to improve preparedness and resilience in order to protect communities when disasters strike. \u201cWe are committed to funding support to increase resilience, adaptability and preparedness,\u201d she said. \u201cOur disaster ready fund initiative will provide another $200m of investment in 2025-26.\u201d McBain said she had been on the ground in NSW, where she saw \u201cfirst-hand the effects a disaster can have\u201d, and had been meeting with small businesses and primary producers that had been \u201chit hard\u201d. \u201cIt is my priority to work closely with all levels of government to ensure support is provided as quickly as possible,\u201d she said. McBain said the federal government would \u201ccontinue to work with NSW on any other funding requests\u201d. \u201cFor a lot of these people, it\u2019s the cumulative impact of a number of events, and we understand that,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why recovery isn\u2019t going to be over the next couple of days when cameras and lights are on the area. It\u2019s going to be days, weeks and months that we\u2019ll walk with these communities.\u201d",

        "raw_text": "Australia\u2019s trade minister, Don Farrell, has described Donald Trump\u2019strade tariffsas \u201cunjustified and not the act of a friend\u201d, after the US president announced he would doubleimport duties on steel and aluminiumto 50%. Trump told a steelworkers rally in Pittsburgh that raising the tariff would \u201ceven further secure the steel industry in the United States. Nobody is going to get around that\u201d. Ina social media poston Saturday, Trump clarified the increase from 25% to 50% would be effective from 4 June and would apply to steel and aluminium. Australia exports relatively little steel to the US. About 2.5% of US aluminium imports by volume come from Australia, but this is less than 10% of Australia\u2019s total exports of the metal. Reiterating Australia\u2019s stance on the tariffs, Farrell said in a statement on Saturday: \u201cAustralia\u2019s position has been consistent and clear. These tariffs are unjustified and not the act of a friend. \u201cThey are an act of economic self-harm that will only hurt consumers and businesses who rely on free and fair trade. We will continue to engage and advocate strongly for the removal of the tariffs.\u201d Speaking later on Saturday afternoon, Farrell said Australia was calling on Trump to reverse the decision and to drop all tariffs, but said there would be no retaliatory steps. \u201cWhat we need to do now is to convince the Americans that this is, in fact, the wrong course of action,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the wrong policy. It simply pushes up prices for American consumers. And that\u2019s not good for the Americans. And it\u2019s certainly not good for Australian steel and aluminium producers.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The shadow trade minister, Kevin Hogan, said on Saturday that Trump\u2019s announcement was concerning for Australian jobs. \u201cThe Albanese government needs to double its efforts to protect our steel industry and local jobs for our steelworkers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect the United States to honour its obligations under the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement, just as Australia has always done. The strength of our economic partnership has been built on trust and mutual benefit, and any deviation from this agreement undermines the principles of free trade.\u201d Hogan said the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, needed to personally meet Trump during the G7 talks in Canada taking place in two weeks \u201cto develop a personal rapport with the United States president and protect Australian industries\u201d. Hogan said: \u201cThe Coalition want the government to succeed because that is in the national interest.\u201d Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs were initially blocked by a US court this week, which ruled them illegal, before the administrationwon a temporary pause on that ruling on Thursday. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion It is understood a national security provision \u2013 section 232 of theTrade Expansion Act\u2013 does give the US president authority to unilaterally raise tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Marghanita Johnson, the chief executive of the Australian Aluminium Council, said a key concern was the potential for international trade flows to be distorted. The council would keep working with the government, she said. Mark Cain, the chief executive of industry group the Australian Steel Institute, said the increase in tariffs was disappointing. He said: \u201cOne of the concerns we have is that the subsequent disruptions to global steel trade could see Australia become a dumping ground for imported steel. And it could exacerbate the surge in imported low-priced steel that is damaging the industry.\u201d In March, when the steel tariffs came into force, BlueScope Steel, which exports about 300,000 tonnes of steel a year to the US, said it was disappointed the industry had not received the same tariff exemption that was negotiated during Trump\u2019s first term. The company produces more than 3m tonnes of steel each year at its Ohio plant. BlueScope said at the time it was working closely with the Australian government\u2019s trade and diplomatic staff \u201cto ensure the BlueScope investment proposition is fully understood\u201d. Australian economist Prof Justin Wolfers, of the University of Michigan, told Guardian Australia the steel tariffs would probably have little effect on Australian industry, as demand for steel globally should allow companies to find other customers. He said: \u201cWe are talking about very small numbers of people [who work in the steel industry in the US]. But steel is used as an input for a broad array of manufacturing jobs. Steel will be more expensive \u2013 even American steel.\u201d Wolfers pointed toprevious analysis of the impact of 2018 steel tariffsduring the first Trump administration, which found they created about 1,000 more steel jobs but about 75,000 jobs were lost from the wider manufacturing sector. Asked why Trump was implementing the increase, Wolfers said: \u201cThere are some questions better directed to a psychologist than an economist. Trump likes tariffs.\u201d",

Farmers given temporary reprieve from Victorian emergency services levy Farmers will be temporarily spared from paying a hikedemergency services levyas drought support is expanded statewide in Victoria,AAPreports. An extra $37.7m has been earmarked for drought relief in Victoria as paddocks and dams run dry after low autumn rainfall. A Victorian drought relief package, which includes $5000 grants, will be made available across the state after previously being limited to 24 local government areas. Its expansion means all farmers will not pay the increased rate for the expanded emergency services levy in the 2025-26 financial year. Their rate will remain at the same level as 2024-25 and automatically applied to notices for primary production properties. The expansion of drought support was based on Bureau of Meteorology and Agriculture Victoria advice that the worse case for May rainfall had been realised, the premier,Jacinta Allan, said. \u201cAll of Victoria is being now recognised as being affected by drought,\u201d she told reporters in Fiskville on Friday. Under the original changes to the levy from 1 July, the average annual bill was expected to rise $678 for primary producers and $63 for residential homeowners. Spooked by the backlash, the Allan government lowered the rate for farmers and introduced rebates for CFA and SES volunteers and life members. The expanded levy was meant raise an extra $2.1bn over the next three years to cover more emergency service agencies in the face of more frequent and intense natural disasters. The treasurer,Jaclyn Symes, said the recent tweaks would leave the budget $73m worse off but she remained confident of delivering an operating surplus of $600m in 2025-26. Parents warned of overdose from over-the-counter medicines Parents grabbing over-the-counter medicine to help their children is causing a startling number of hospital visits, researchers say. AAPreports almost 100 children and teenagers are being taken to emergency departments every day after taking over-the-counter medicines such as paracetamol and antidepressants. At least half of these visits are preventable due to being accidental or intentional overdoses or adult-only medication, University of South Australia researchers said. The Royal Children\u2019s Hospital emergency medicine director says intentional overdoses can be particularly concerning. \u201c[Paracetamol] is one of the scary medications where early on, there may be very minimal symptoms,\u201dDr Stuart Lewenatold AAP. It\u2019s only going to be when the paracetamol is starting to cause damage to the liver [when] we\u2019ll start to see symptoms of nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In the case of accidental ingestions, he said parents and carers can be \u201cflustered, anxious, worried about the error they\u2019ve made\u201d, delaying treatment. Lewena said hospitals are stretched and urged parents to keep medication out of children\u2019s reach. Parents should particularly keep an eye on prescription medications as one tablet can cause harm to children. Kids are incredibly resourceful at getting to things that they know they\u2019re not meant to get to. It\u2019s worthwhile having a discussion with your pharmacist or doctor to know \u2026 \u2018how risky is this in my household?\u2019 In February, the federal government changed the number of paracetamol tablets per pack from 20 to 16 in general stores and 50 in pharmacy medicine packs. Queensland government say nurses union hasn\u2019t made pay counteroffer Queensland\u2019s state government says the nurses union has not put forward a counteroffer after rejecting a pay offer this week. SecretarySarah Beamanannounced earlier today that the Queensland Nurses and Midwives Union is \u201clikely\u201d to start industrial action next week. Stage one is likely to consist of things like wearing campaign shirts and badges. It is the first strike action by the union in 23 years. A spokesperson for the health minister,Tim Nicholls, said the government would \u201ccontinue to negotiate in good faith with the union\u201d. It\u2019s disappointing that the union has rejected two offers that fulfil the government\u2019s election commitment to deliver national-leading wages and conditions for our nurses and midwives. We will continue to negotiate in good faith with the union. To date, a counteroffer has not been put forward by the union. Liberals \u2018lost sight of\u2019 culture of constructive debate and openness to being challenged: Archer Bridget Archersaid a culture of being able to talk frankly and disagree with colleagues in the party may have diminished in the last term as a result of the turnover of Liberal leaders during the last Coalition government, and the sense of a need for discipline. I think \u2026 we lost sight of the fact that we need to have these disagreements, we need to have constructive debates, we need to be open to being challenged and criticised and to challenge and criticise other views. Archer said the Liberal party also needs to examine how it speaks to electorates across the country and the diversity of people it seeks to represent. She said the Liberal party put too much emphasis on the no vote in the voice referendum as a signal on how people might vote in the federal election. Archer said she wouldn\u2019t rule out a future in politics but \u201cnot at the moment\u201d. Former Liberal MP Bridget Archer says party needs \u2018to get back to what it means to be Liberals\u2019 The former Liberal MPBridget Archer, who lost her seat in the federal election earlier this month, has said the Liberal party needs to reassert its own brand, and while the Coalition is important, the Liberals and Nationals need to be two distinct parties. She told ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing: I think that that\u2019s been lost somewhere along the way, possibly with that formal alliance of the LNP in Queensland. Whereas here in Tasmania, for example, where I am, there really hasn\u2019t been able to be a Nationals presence established. We still have, I think, a very strong Liberal brand here and I think that\u2019s been something I have been saying for a long time, that we need to get back to what it means to be Liberals. Not going one way or the other, but actually just getting back to our sort of core values which, yes, probably and we have been most electorally successful has been in the centre. Archer said comments that the Coalition should pull out of net zero do not land well with her: What we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of is not whether we have a commitment to net zero or not, it\u2019s what we do to achieve that emissions reduction that is so important and necessary. So, we can spend a lot of time arguing about the ideology of these things or we can just get on and develop a serious plan to actually deal with the problem. Marles says ASPI report recommending more defence spending not \u2018deep in analysis\u2019 The defence minister,Richard Marles, has described an Australian Strategic Policy Institute report on defence spending as \u201cnot a report which is particularly intellectually satisfying or, at the end of the day, ultimately deep in analysis\u201d. There has been a war of words exchanged between the Albanese government and the thinktank since it concluded that the level of defence spending in this year\u2019s federal budget would make Australia less secure. Marles told ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing: What we saw, in my view with the ASPI report is not a report which is particularly intellectually satisfying or at the end of the day ultimately deep in analysis \u2026. It is the easiest thing in the world to go out there and say that you should spend more \u2013 in fact, we are; we are spending significantly more. There [are] references to the impact of inflation; well, the impact of inflation is built into what we spend and what we are spending is way beyond inflation, but at the end of the day you only have to look at what we inherited from the former Coalition government which was $42bn worth of unfunded projects. He said the Albanese government is fixing up \u201cthe mess\u201d and moving forward with a very clear, strategic direction on defence. He said ASPI should be held accountable for its conclusions, and analysis needed to be \u201cdeep and thoughtful\u201d and \u201cobjective\u201d. Port of Darwin ownership did not come up in discussions with Hegseth: Marles Richard Marlessaid getting the Port of Darwin back in Australian hands did not come up in his discussions withHegseth. When asked about aid cuts made by the Trump administration, Marles said he wouldn\u2019t go into the extent of what was spoken about in the discussion. He said development assistance is one means to provide stability and security in our region, but it isn\u2019t the only means. He said the previous Trump administration made a significant contribution to supporting Pacific Island countries. So I think the importance of those countries is well understood and again, we see ourselves very much as partners with the United States and how we can move forward in that. MarlessaidHegsethdid raise the issue of defence spending, but Marles said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t put a number on it\u201d, when asked whether the US wanted Australia to raise defence spending to 3% of GDP, as the US has asked of its allies. Marles said Australia is raising defence spending. He said the Australian government was open to discussion about more defence spending. We have done a lot already. But we are absolutely up for having this conversation and we want to calibrate our defence spending to meet the strategic moment that we all face. I said this lots of times. In a rational world, defence spending is a function of strategic threat. There is definitely strategic threat in the world today and we are rational people. Marles says Aukus moving forward and meeting timelines after meeting with US counterpart Pete Hegseth The defence minister,Richard Marles, says he has a sense of optimism about the Australia-US relationship after meeting his US counterpart,Pete Hegseth, at the Shangri Dialogue in Singapore earlier today. Marles told ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing: We talked about the shared challenge we had in terms of providing security and stability within the Indo-Pacific, how we can work more closely together to do that and obviously we work very closely together right now, and to try and make our contribution to an Indo-Pacific which is underpinned by the values that Australia and the United States shares which is democracy and the rule of law, but it is a really good meeting, it built on the meeting that we had in February of this year in Washington DC, and it certainly leaves me with a sense of optimism about how we can very much work together to take this agenda forward. He said they talked about the development of Aukus as critical to the collective security of the Indo-Pacific. He said Aukus is moving forward and meeting its timelines. It is a great opportunity for both of our countries and there are a whole lot of challenges in this, obviously, and we are certainly far from sanguine about meeting all of those challenges but fundamentally, Aukus is happening and we talked about how we need to maintain the momentum of that. The federal budget deficit is already running $4.8bn better than expected in the financial year to April, according to the Department of Finance\u2019s latest monthly statements. To be clear: the nation\u2019s finances are still in the red, just not as deeply as anticipated a couple of months ago. The March 25 budget forecast an underlying cash deficit of $24bn in the first 10 months of 2024-25. But the departmental figures show the actual deficit for the period came in at $19.2bn. The rapid improvement was powered by corporate taxes coming in $3.2bn better than anticipated, the statements show. High commodity prices may explain the larger than anticipated tax take on profits: the iron ore price is still sky high, trading at about $US96 a tonne, despite the global jitters caused by Trump\u2019s tariffs. The March budget predicted last financial year\u2019s surplus of $15.8bn would flip to a $27.6bn deficit in 2024-25 \u2013 the start of a string of deficits. \u201cThe budgetary bad news is arriving more slowly than Treasury and Finance forecast,\u201d the independent economist,Chris Richardson, said. Victorian Liberal deputy rejects claims of taxpayer-funded car rort A tennis ace turned Liberal hot shot is staring down calls to quit, rejecting allegations of a drunken, taxpayer-funded car rort,AAPreports.Victorian Liberal deputySam Grothused then-opposition upper house leaderGeorgie Crozier\u2019s chauffeur-driven vehicle to take him and his wife home from the Australian Open in January 2024.The trip from Melbourne Park to Rye on the Mornington Peninsula is about 100km.The former tennis player had earlier hosted a political fundraiser with Nationals MPJade Benham.Groth and Benham, along with their respective spouses, then entered a party zone inside the tennis precinct, the Herald Sun reports.The former Davis Cup representative was accused of getting \u201csmashed\u201d and misleading Crozier by telling her he wanted to borrow the car for a work event.He was shadow minister for tourism, sport and events at the time and elected the party\u2019s deputy leader in December afterJohn Pesuttolost the leadership toBrad Battin.In a statement on Friday, Groth confirmed he attended the event in both an official and personal capacity. I was at the event to meet various stakeholders and attend meetings before being part of a fundraising initiative.The accusations around intoxication are wrong. Groth argued it was all officially disclosed and he had \u201cnothing to hide\u201d, but the travel allowance entry on his register of interest does not specifically mention the fundraiser.Battin firmly stood by his deputy when asked if he should resign.Victoria\u2019s ministerial code of conduct says public resources must not be used for \u201cimproper personal or private advantage or benefit for themselves or any other person\u201d, or for political party purposes. Queensland nurses \u2018likely\u2019 to start industrial action next week Queensland nurses and midwives are \u201clikely\u201d to start industrial action next week, after rejecting a revised pay offer from the state government today. Nurses union secretarySarah Beamansaid stage one of industrial action would include things like wearing campaign shirts and badges. The union\u2019s 55,000 members operate in public health facilities such as hospitals and QueenslandHealthclinics statewide. \u201cWe are preparing to commence protected industrial action as early as next week,\u201d Beaman said. More than 96% of those who voted said yes to taking protected industrial action to protect patients and their colleagues. Protected industrial action will likely begin in Queensland health facilities statewide next week. I would like to remind Queensland that patients and aged care resident safety remains paramount during protected industrial action which has been approved by the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission. Union members rejected a state government pay offer and voted to take industrial action this week. The state government updated its offer, but the union said it remains \u201csubpar\u201d and would reduce rights and conditions. \u201cThe government threatened us with the removal of eight weeks\u2019 backpay if we didn\u2019t accept this substandard offer by close of business today. However, we continue to stand strong for a fair agreement and the backpay the government owes us,\u201d Beaman said. The nurses union hasn\u2019t walked off the job since 2002. It will give three days\u2019 notice of any industrial action. The week of media news is here withAmanda Meade\u2019s Weekly Beast. Hanson welcomes One Nation\u2019s best ever election results Pauline Hansonhas welcomed her party\u2019s best ever election result, with a fourth senator confirmed elected today. The newly electedWarwick Staceyin NSW andTyron Whittenin Western Australia join Hanson and the re-electedMalcolm Robertsin Queensland, taking the One Nation contingent to four in the Senate. That equals the party\u2019s best result in the 2016 double-dissolution election. Hanson: Our national vote increased significantly across Australia at this election thanks to a strong campaign with great candidates, common sense policies and dedicated volunteers.There is no more dedicated servant of Queensland than Malcolm Roberts and he\u2019s seen off challengers from all sides to be re-elected yet again. I\u2019m also delighted that Tyron Whitten and Warwick Stacey will be joining us on the Senate crossbench. They both have much to offer their respective states and they are great additions to our team.This team will continue the work we have always done in parliament on behalf of the Australian people: hold this toxic Labor government to account; raise the important issues; embody the strong conservative values that built this nation; defend our democracy, rights and freedoms; and put our country and its people first. In his first comments since being elected, Whitten said: I\u2019m looking forward to representing the people of WA and standing for the values that make this country great. That\u2019s all for me today, I\u2019ll leave you withJosh Taylorwho will guide you through the rest of today\u2019s news. Take care.

This has not taken into account climate impact \u2026 This is a project that is being approved through 2070,when my kids will be grandparents, and I just don\u2019t buy that this is a necessary decision to make now, given what we know about the climate impact of the project. Chaney went on to say environment minister Murray Watt\u2019s decision was based on a regulatory framework that does not take climate impact into account. And that is the fundamental problem. Kevin Hogan says Coalition should \u2018absolutely\u2019 aspire to have more women in leadership Shadow trade minister Kevin Hogan was asked about criticisms that Coalition leadership had fewer women than under Peter Dutton\u2019s final shadow cabinet. Hogan told Afternoon Briefing: I think that should always be an aspiration that we have ... I think we should always aspire to have more women representatives. Hogan went on to say that Dutton\u2019s shadow cabinet had a similar make-up of men and women in the last parliament, but \u201cthat made no difference to people\u2019s voting intentions\u201d. But I take your point.

In QLD, the LNP\u2019s Paul Scarr was first elected, alongside colleague Susan McDonald; Nita Green from Labor was elected second, alongside Corinne Mulholland. Larissa Waters, the Greens leader, came fifth and Pauline Hanson\u2019s deputyMalcolm Roberts came in sixth position. In WA, Labor\u2019s Ellie Whiteaker was first elected, alongside Varun Ghosh; Slade Brockman for the Liberals was second, with Matt O\u2019Sullivan; the Greens\u2019 Jordon Steele-John was re-elected in fourth spot, with Whitten coming sixth. It will take One Nation to three senators, alongside Hanson who is up for election next term. Whitten, according to a bio on One Nation\u2019s website, \u201cbelieves in a strong national energy policy that prioritises Australian resources, making power more affordable and reliable. He will also fight to end the reckless mass immigration policies that are driving up housing costs and putting immense strain on infrastructure and essential services\u201d. The bio adds: Our government is selling out Australians with policies that benefit corporations and global bureaucracies while leaving our own people struggling. It\u2019s time to put Australians first. Ayres says Albanese will stand up for Australia if he speaks with Donald Trump at G7 next month The ABC\u2019s Patricia Karvelas asked Ayres how the prime minister will advocate for the country after the tariff ruling at next month\u2019s G7 summit in Canada. He said: I think what you\u2019d expect to see is Anthony Albanese as the Australian prime minister standing up for Australia\u2019s interest in a calm and consistent way. It certainly won\u2019t be, as you say, begging any global leader for anything. We do things the Australian way here. Tim Ayres says Labor will keep pushing Australian interests after US court blocks Trump tariffs Industry and science minister Tim Ayres said the Labor government would continue to focus on advancing Australia\u2019s interests, saying he wasreluctant to commentona recent court rulingthat blocked US president Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cliberation day\u201d tariffs. Ayers said the most \u201csensible\u201d approach would be to wait and see what happens in the US court system rather than get too excited by the move, adding to the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing: What we want to do is keep squarely focused on Australia\u2019s interest \u2026 [The tariffs are] an unwelcome development in terms of the bilateral relationship, the bilateral economic relationship, but what I\u2019m concerned about as well, and the government is concerned about, is the impact on the rules-based order and the global trading system that Australia relies upon so much. Queensland begins review of puberty blockers Queensland\u2019s review of puberty blockers has begun.HealthministerTim Nichollsbanned all public prescribing of puberty blockers for transgender children in January. They are still available for cisgender children. He also ordered a review to be led by psychiatrist Ruth Vine. It will inquire into \u201cthe strength of the evidence base for using Stage 1 and Stage 2 hormones to treat gender dysphoria\u201d among other things. According to its terms of reference, the review \u201cmay consider\u201d published grey literature, including the Cass Review which led to a ban on prescribing puberty blockers in the United Kingdom. A review completed last yearrecommended the state government double fundingfor the Brisbane-based Queensland Children\u2019s Gender Service and improve regional coverage. Nicholls has announced the government will not implement its recommendations. A range of health bodies including the Australian Medical Association called for the ban to be lifted. Queensland Health director general David Rosengren said the state government had commissioned an independent review because \u201cthe evidence supporting the use of these therapies is contested\u201d. Public consultation was opened today. It closes on 29 July. The review is due to be completed by 30 November.

Australia has thehighest rates of bowel cancer in people under 50in the world, with early-onset cases in that demographic rising by up to 8% a year. It\u2019s thedeadliest cancerfor Australians aged 25 to 44, and experts say it\u2019s important to raise awareness about the signs and symptoms that are often dismissed. The most common signs and symptoms of early-onset bowel cancer are blood in the stool, abdominal pain, a change in bowel habits and unexplained weight loss.So who\u2019s eligible for screening? The Guardian\u2019s Natasha May has more here: Victorian branch of AMWU calls for Labor to recognise Palestinian statehood The Victorian branch of the Australian Manufacturing Workers\u2019 Union (AMWU) has called for the Albanese Labor governmentto recognise Palestinian statehoodand redouble efforts to call for a ceasefire in Gaza \u2013 adding to growing public comments from inside the Labor tent for more action. We\u2019ve reported in recent days on Labor grassroots members urging the government to go further,including considering sanctions on Israel and recognising Palestine. Former foreign ministers Bob Carr and Gareth Evans have also lent their weight to such calls. The state secretary of the Victorian branch of the Australian Manufacturing Workers\u2019 Union (AMWU),Tony Mavromatis, said the Labor government should move toward recognition of Palestinian statehood, sanctions on the Netanyahu government, an increase in humanitarian aid and for a genuine ceasefire in Gaza. Mavromatis said: Now that the Albanese Labor government has been re-elected with a large majority, it is the opportune time to take a bold stand on this and other issues. We just came out of a highly contested election where the Palestinian issue featured prominently. My members see the result as an endorsement of Labor\u2019s policy on Palestine, which calls for recognition before a solution is reached. As a union that has been active and vocal on Palestine, we lend our support to all those within the Labor caucus and movement to urge the prime minister and the foreign minister to announce Australia\u2019s recognition of Palestinian statehood at next month\u2019s UN high-level conference co-hosted by France and Saudi Arabia. Mavromatis said AMWU members weresupportive of sanctions on individuals and institutions guilty of human rights violations, and backed protests against the Netanyahu government. He added: The Australian Labor government needs to persist with calling for the immediate and genuine ceasefire in Gaza, an end of encroachment by Israeli settlers, militia and military into the West Bank, the full reinstatement and increase of humanitarian aid to Gaza and the West Bank, including the continued stabilization of UNWRA, and respect for international law and human rights.

More than 7,000 insurance claims from NSW regions affected by floods Insurers have received more than 7,000 claims from the mid north coast and Hunter regions affected by floods, the Insurance Council of Australia says. There were about 6,000 claimsyesterday. \u201cClaims numbers have been steadily increasing over the past week as residents and business owners have been able to get back into properties to assess the damage and begin the clean-up,\u201d ICA said in a statement. The Insurance Council and insurers are focused on assisting communities in the recovery and have prioritised making clean-up and claims guidance as accessible as possible. This includes direct text messages to policyholders, updates in insurer apps, and having representatives on the ground in centres across the region. There are now Insurance Hubs in Taree and Port Macquarie. Inside the Bradfield recount: painstaking and polite, but sometimes heartbreaking The Bradfield recount is being held in a warehouse in Asquith that appears to have been used for a number of northern Sydney electorates, but on my visit only Bradfield is being counted. A space is set aside as a break room for scrutineers, with large teams for the teal candidate,Nicolette Boele,and the Liberal,Gisele Kapterian,whofinished just eight votes aheadafter the first complete count. Given there weremore than 6,500 informal votes in Bradfield(5.51% of those cast), the potential for decisions over validity to settle the outcome are obvious. Each candidate has at least enough scrutineers to have one watching every person counting. The regular counting space is divided into a series of bays. Each bay is dealing with one polling place at a time. The first part of the process is to conduct a fresh first-preference count. Ballot papers are already in bundles of 50, in first preference order. Each counter takes one bundle at a time and removes the rubber band, then carefully checks each ballot to ensure it is formal and that the first preference is correct. It is then laid on a pile facing the scrutineers, who can observe it. This process happens more slowly and carefully than you would expect for an election night count. Read the full story: Winter will be warmer and in some places wetter than average this year, the Bureau of Meteorology says. \u201cWhile winter is a time for cooler weather, the winter long-range forecast shows day and night temperatures are likely to be above average across Australia for this time of the year,\u201d BoM said in its forecast. Rainfall is also expected to be above average for interior and central parts of the country, while parts of the tropical north, south-east and south-west will see rainfall in the typical range. This includes in parts of South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania that have been affected by prolonged dry conditions as well as parts of New South Wales recently impacted by severe flooding, BoM said. This winter forecast follows an autumn which was much wetter than average in the north and east of Australia, and much drier than average in many southern parts. There is also an \u201cunseasonal increased riskof fire this winter\u201d across parts of South Australia and Victoria.",

        "raw_text": "Australia will continue to push Donald Trump to abandon his administration\u2019s tariff regime entirely, after aUS court blocked the president\u2019s \u201cliberation day\u201d tariffsfrom coming into effect. The Manhattan-based court of international trade said the US constitution gives the Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other countries, and ruled that power was not superseded by the president\u2019s self-declared \u201cemergency\u201d he cited to safeguard the US economy. The Trump White House filed an appeal against the judgment minutes after it was handed down. The regime imposed a10% across-the-board tariff on all Australian importsto the US. Several specific products, includingsteelandaluminium, are subject to higher tariff rates, up to 25%, which are not impacted by the court\u2019s ruling. The Australian trade minister, Don Farrell, said the Australian government would agitate for tariffs on Australian goods to be dumped entirely. \u201cWe will study this ruling of the US Federal Courts on reciprocal tariffs closely and note that they may be subject to further legal processes through the courts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Albanese Government has been consistent in the view that these tariffs on Australian imports into the US are unjustified,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cWe will continue to engage and strongly advocate for the removal of tariffs.\u201d \u201cThe Albanese Government will always stand up for Australia\u2019s national interests, including Australian jobs and Australian industries.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The US court found Trump overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board tariffs on imports from countries all over the world.Trump called the tariffs, announced on 2 April,America\u2019s \u201cliberation day\u201d. \u201cThe court does not pass upon the wisdom or likely effectiveness of the President\u2019s use of tariffs as leverage. That use is impermissible not because it is unwise or ineffective, but because (federal law) does not allow it,\u201d a three-judge panel said in the decision. The ruling came in a pair of lawsuits, one filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small US businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties and the other by 13 US states. The companies \u2013 which range from a New York wine and spirits importer to a Virginia-based maker of educational kits and musical instruments \u2013 have said the tariffs will hurt their ability to do business. The lawsuit argued that the statue invoked by the president \u2013 the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) \u2013 does not give him the authority to unilaterally issue across-the-board worldwide tariffs. \u201cHis claimed emergency is a figment of his own imagination: trade deficits, which have persisted for decades without causing economic harm, are not an emergency. Nor do these trade deficits constitute an \u2018unusual and extraordinary threat\u2019,\u201d it argued. Court documents specifically cited thetariffs imposed on Australian territories where there are no people, and, hence, no commerce. \u201cThe Liberation Day Order imposed sweeping new tariffs at rates not seen since the Great Depression \u2013 including a global 10% tariffs on nearly all countries in the world \u2013 regardless of whether they impose tariffs on United States products, the rates at which they do so, or the existence of any trade agreements governing the relationship. \u201cThese tariffs even applied to places with no civilian population or international trade activity, such as [Australian territories] the Heard and McDonald Islands, which are inhabited only by penguins and seals.\u201d Australian financial analysts have warned that significant uncertainty remained around the ultimate fate of Trump\u2019s tariff regime. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst with Capital.com in Melbourne, said the court\u2019s ruling was massive news. \u201cIt\u2019s long been suggested that the emergency powers Trump has used to implement tariffs were unconstitutional and that the power to enact tariffs sits with Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sets up a battle that will likely end up in the supreme court now. It\u2019s a situation fraught with danger because the administration may ignore the court\u2019s ruling, potentially placing greater strain on US institutions at a time of increased stress.\u201d Sean Callow, a senior analyst at ITC Markets in Sydney, said while there must be significant caution over the ruling being overturned by higher courts, \u201cfor now the weight of money is being placed on the possibility that US courts prevent the White House from self-imposed economic damage, brightening US growth prospects and the US dollar\u201d. The White House and lawyers for groups that sued did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff and one of Trump\u2019s lead policy advisers, rebuked the court in a brief social media post, writing: \u201cThe judicial coup is out of control.\u201d At least five other legal challenges to the tariffs are pending. The attorney general of Oregon, Dan Rayfield, a Democrat whose office is leading the states\u2019 lawsuit, called Trump\u2019s tariffs unlawful, reckless and economically devastating. \u201cThis ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can\u2019t be made on the president\u2019s whim,\u201d Rayfield said in a statement. Under US law, tariffs must typically be approved by Congress. Trump has claimed broad authority to set tariffs under IEEPA, which is meant to address \u201cunusual and extraordinary\u201d threats during a national emergency. The law has historically been used to impose sanctions on enemies of the US or freeze their assets. Trump is the first US president to use it to impose tariffs.

        "raw_text": "The misuse of non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements in the music industry to silence victims of harassment and abuse is a \u201cmajor concern\u201d, which should be banned immediately in order to tackle the sector\u2019s \u201cculture of misogyny\u201d, a new parliament report recommends. Misogyny in Music: On Repeat is the third such report by the women and equalities committee. Its predecessor, published in January 2024, found that women working in the sector faced misogyny and discrimination, with rife sexual harassment and abuse, to which the industry\u2019s many self-employed practitioners were more vulnerable. Despite music industry support for the report, the previous Conservative government declined to implement any of its recommendations. In September 2024, the Labour party conference passed a motion calling on the government to implement the committee\u2019s report in full. On publication of the latest report, a government spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cThe music industry must be free of misogyny and discrimination and NDAs should not be misused to silence victims. We are actively looking at all options for further reform of NDAs.\u201d In the year since the previous report, the committee, led by Labour MP Sarah Owen, said that little had changed from its previous characterisation of the culture of the British music industry as a \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d. Hearing evidence from pop-soul artist Celeste and the classical soprano Lucy Cox, along with representatives from the organisations Black Lives in Music and the Musicians\u2019 Union, it found barriers including unequal pay, ageism and unequal responsibility for childcare duties; harassment, particularly for LGBTQ+ women, women of colour and disabled women. It established that women reported mistreatment at low rates because of fear of retaliation. Musicians\u2019 Union data showed that despite 51% of women in the sector experiencing gender discrimination and 47% of women of colour experiencing racism, only 11% and 8% respectively reported their allegations. Secretary Naomi Pohl told the committeethat even initiatives designed to protect women within the sector \u201cstill exist within a system that doesn\u2019t prioritise women\u2019s safety and none of the organisations have the power to change that culture\u201d. \u201cThe need for government intervention is clear,\u201d the committee said. \u201cThere remains an overwhelming case for the government to implement the measures set out in our predecessors\u2019 report, and the updated recommendations set out in this report.\u201d It stressed that their recommendations would also benefit women working across all sectors. The committee once again backed the proposedCreative Industries Independent Standards Authority (CIISA), a non-statutory standards authority designed \u201cto improve standards of behaviour across the creative industries and to prevent and tackle all forms of bullying and harassment\u201d. CIISA chair Jen Smith said that the authority would benefit victims as well as smaller employers seeking advice on how to deal with issues such as implementing investigations procedures. Additionally it stressed that female and gender non-conforming freelancers within the music industry were additionally vulnerable, and not sufficiently protected by the employment rights bill despite proposing stronger protections from third-party harassment. The committee called on the government to amend the Equality Act and the Employment Rights bill to ensure their safety. The committee stressed that parents and carers also faced unique challenges, especially when those responsibilities intersected with freelance employment and late and unpredictable working hours, and called for the government to align maternity allowance with statutory maternity pay to facilitate greater flexibility during leave. Soprano Lucy Cox told the committee: \u201cIn the very first audition I did, I was told that I would need to wait for somebody to become pregnant or die in order to start getting any work as a classical singer.\u201d She described \u201ca feeling that you have ended your job by having a child\u201d: after having a baby, longer tours became unviable owing to the cost of travelling with her husband, yet committing to the tours remained essential to \u201cmaintain my foothold because \u2026 if you do not do the work then somebody else might well do it, and then you might not get invited back.\u201d Dr Charisse Beaumont, CEO ofBlack Lives in Music,expressed her impatience with a lack of decisive progress on the issues. \u201cWe need the government to get involved,\u201d she told the committee. \u201cWe do not need any more reports. We need the [previous committee\u2019s] report to be actioned.\u201d After the publication of the report, Deborah Annetts, chief executive of the Independent Society of Musicians who gave evidence in the hearings, also called for action. \u201cIt\u2019s to the previous government\u2019s shame that it rejected all the recommendations of the first report,\u201d she said. \u201cThis government must not make the same mistake \u2026 [and must] make the sector safer.\u201d",

        "raw_text": "There is a battle gripping the music business today around the manipulation of streaming services \u2013 and innocent indie artists are the collateral damage. Fraudsters are flooding Spotify, Apple Music and the rest with AI-generated tracks, to try and hoover up the royalties generated by people listening to them. These tracks are cheap, quick and easy to make, with Deezer estimating in April that over20,000 fully AI-created tracks\u2013 that\u2019s 18% of new tracks \u2013 were being ingested into its platform daily, almost double the number in January. The fraudsters often then use bots, AI or humans to endlessly listen to these fake songs and generate revenue, while others are exploiting upload services to get fake songs put on real artists\u2019 pages and siphon off royalties that way. Spotify fines the worst offenders and says it puts \u201csignificant engineering resources and research into detecting, mitigating, and removing artificial streaming activity\u201d, whileApple Musicclaims \u201cless than 1% of all streams are manipulated\u201d on its service. That may sound encouraging, but in a streaming business worth$20.4bn globally(according to the IFPI), it\u2019s likely that hundreds of millions of dollars are being skimmed off annually by rogue operators. Part of the problem is that while the barriers of entry for musicians have been dramatically lowered \u2013 uploading songs to streaming services is much easier than manufacturing CDs or vinyl \u2013 the barriers of entry for fraudsters are lower too. So the industry has declared war, but hair-trigger automated detection systems mean that artists are seeing their music taken offline even when they\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Darren Owen, chief operating officer of music distribution company Fuga, suggests streaming fraud \u201cstarted to blow up across the industry\u201d around 2021. Grappling with it now makes up 50% of his workload. Using AI and machine learning, Fuga gives streaming patterns a \u201cseverity score\u201d, separating out \u201cnon-human listening patterns\u201d to spot fraud. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to listen to the same song at the same time across multiple devices,\u201d Owen says, noting that countries like India, Vietnam, Thailand and parts of eastern Europe are hotbeds of click-farm activity, using low-paid workers. \u201cIt\u2019s become clear that organised criminals are involved in it as well.\u201d It is not just services like pimpyourfollower.de in Germany \u2013 which was taken offline after a court injunction \u2013 and others in Canada and Brazil who are being targeted by record industry trade bodies for offering artificially inflated streams. Universal Music Group (UMG), the biggest record company in the world, has been accused by Drake of conspiring to increase the play count of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s diss track Not Like Us, an allegation UMG denies. The Guardian has spoken to multiple artists who found themselves at the sharp end of this war on manipulation, where unexpected spikes in streams get taken as proof of guilt. Darren Hemmings is managing director of music marketing company Motive Unknown and a musician himself. His distributor recently informed him that a track on one EP, having jumped from \u201ca few plays a day\u201d to more than 1,000, was guilty of manipulation. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t blame them for drawing that conclusion,\u201d he says, but \u201cit\u2019s very judge, jury, executioner\u201d. He did not manipulate the streams, but could not identify the root cause \u2013 other than it simply becoming popular with actual listeners. Northern Irish rock band Final Thirteen had some of their music taken off streaming services due to a spike in the tens of thousands. They suspect this came after a play on Radio 1, but their distributor automatically concluded they were manipulated. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard for any artist to prove that they didn\u2019t [manipulate streams], but it\u2019s even harder forSpotifyto prove that they did,\u201d says their drummer, Doobes. \u201c[They] take it down and that\u2019s it.\u201d Adam J Morgan, who makes music as indie act Naked & Baked, had a track get over 10,000 streams in a week, possibly from use in a TikTok video, but it was zapped by his distributor RouteNote as suspicious. \u201cI hadn\u2019t done anything wrong and they didn\u2019t provide any evidence,\u201d he says, believing it was down to an overly anxious RouteNote. \u201cI spent that weekend trying to work out what was going on, but Spotify said my music hadn\u2019t been flagged at all.\u201d RouteNote did not respond to a request for an interview. Takedowns can cause musicians inconvenience, derail marketing and cost them money. Matthew Whiteside, artistic director of experimental classical event The Night With\u2026 (and head of the TNW Music label) had three different albums taken down amid claims of artificial streaming. He tracked it back: TNW Music tracks were being added to manipulated playlists. \u201cIt made no sense [why they were added] based on the genre.\u201d His distributor said he could resubmit the album again, at $40 per album, but with no guarantee it would not be removed again. \u201cStreaming in general is geared against the smaller and the niche,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we get 1,000 streams a month on an album, I\u2019d be very happy.\u201d As such, paying to resubmit an album is beyond their release budget. Deezer claims it was the first streaming service to implement fraud detection systems. \u201cWe look at a lot of indicators that help our algorithm decide if a user is fraudulent or not,\u201d says Thibault Roucou, the company\u2019s royalties and reporting director. \u201cWhen we ask for a takedown, we look manually at what\u2019s happening and we\u2019re very confident that it is extreme manipulation.\u201d Unfortunately, systems elsewhere for taking down tracks often presume guilt and the appeals system is so arduous that small acts, already struggling, just give up. Pop singer Levina, who represented Germany at Eurovision in 2017, saw her music taken off streaming services without warning \u2013 it was flagged because she unintentionally had the same name as another artist. \u201cWith streaming services, it\u2019s almost impossible to [appeal] through them,\u201d she sighs. \u201cYou fill out a form but it leaves you quite powerless.\u201d She is also chair of the artist council within trade body Featured Artists Coalition, and they are finalising \u201cminimum standards for what distributors should be doing\u201d. She proposes a traffic light warning system that allows acts time to present their defence or take action to address the problems. Streaming services and distributors now accept this battle is about containment rather than total elimination. Owen, however, says the latest iteration is not fraudsters manipulating the streams of a few tracks by large amounts, but rather boosting multiple tracks a small amount to fly under detection radars. For Hemmings, this could result in a two-tier streaming economy, with smaller acts abandoning the main streaming platforms, where earnings are derisory anyway, to focus on a service such as Bandcamp. \u201cThis could provoke a conclusion among large swathes of the independent music community that they\u2019re just better off focusing on other ways to make money.\u201d",

        "raw_text": "InKate Nash\u2019s new single, released last week, the 37-year-old musician and actor has coined a new acronym, Germ: \u201cgirl, exclusionary, regressive, misogynist\u201d. In the lyrics, she states: \u201cYou\u2019re not radical \u2026 You\u2019re not rad at all,\u201d and that \u201cusing feminism to erase the rights of others and endanger them is inherently un-feminist\u201d. It arose from Nash seeing \u201ctrans-exclusionary radical feminist\u201d \u2013the contentious term \u201cterf\u201d\u2013 as something of a misnomer. Those who espouse gender-critical views are, in her opinion, neither radical nor feminist. The song was written in response to last month\u2019ssupreme court rulingthat the legal definition of \u201cwoman\u201d ought to be based on biological sex (a judgement that doctors at the British Medical Association have called \u201cscientifically illiterate\u201d). \u201cI have a lot of trans people in my life that I care about,\u201d Nash tells me on the day the track is released. \u201cThis feminist-trans \u2018debate\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s not a debate to me. A friend of mine was the victim of a hate crime last year. I took the ruling very personally.\u201d She says the time felt right for her to speak out. \u201cThe LGBTQIA+ community supports women so much, and they have been there for me in my life and career. That\u2019s why I think cis women really owe it to trans people to step up at this moment. This song is for that community.\u201d Within hours of the song going live, Nash was trending on X. On the one hand, Nash was praised by LGBTQ+ advocates and allies for showing support for trans people at a time when their rights are being eroded. \u201cA lot of the queer community have been really grateful,\u201d says Nash. \u201cI\u2019ve received some beautiful messages about what it means, when there\u2019s so much uncertainty and fear and a loss of confidence for a lot of trans people. That\u2019s been really moving.\u201d On the other hand, gender-critical voices online suggested that Nash was \u201cenabling abusers\u201d by calling for trans women to be admitted into single-sex spaces. Nash finds the accusation \u201cabsurd\u201d. Critiquing different ideologies is important, she says, \u201cbut there\u2019s a difference between critical thinking and what\u2019s happening in this debate. I\u2019m really open to nuanced conversations. I was preparing myself for this really amazing argument that stitches me up, a big \u2018gotcha\u2019 moment\u2019. But all the insults are calling me old, a bint, a slag, a has-been. I\u2019m shocked at how juvenile and misogynistic the comments are.\u201d \u201cGerm\u201d, Nash is aware, is another insult now added into the mix. \u201cI\u2019m taking my artistic liberty there as a musician \u2013 I can be highbrow and I can be lowbrow. But I also do think it\u2019s important for feminists to voice that transphobia is not feminist, so I stand by it.\u201d She is ready for the inevitable backlash. \u201cI\u2019ve been trolled since I was 18. Bring it on. I\u2019m OK with whatever insults people want to throw at me \u2013 I can handle it. It\u2019s not going to be as difficult as what a trans person is having to go through at this moment.\u201d She hopes the song encourages others to speak up despite it being such a divisive subject. \u201cIt felt like a scary thing to voice, because it\u2019s this hot topic, but as a musician you can make something that\u2019s quite fun and catchy and a little bit empowering.\u201d Nash has long been an advocate for women\u2019s rights, calling herself a feminist in interviews since she started releasing witty, acerbic songs in the mid-2000s, before Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 made the term a pop cultural concern. She is worried that the label has been hijacked by a gender-critical group who are \u201cvery vocal and very organised\u201d, and that resources would be better spent finding solutions to more pressing problems faced by women, such as sexual violence and femicide, which occuroverwhelminglyat the hands of men. \u201cTaking away the rights of vulnerable people who are not a threat is obviously the wrong thing to be doing,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to trample on people that have less autonomy over their bodies and less safety in the world than me in order to \u2018protect myself\u2019. I do not think cis women are more important or better than trans people.\u201d Nash also made headlines earlier in the year by announcing she was selling photos on OnlyFans to help subsidise her tour. This was done in part to make a serious point about the ways the music industry is failing artists, especially those from working-class backgrounds: \u201cArtists can\u2019t make money from touring and they can\u2019t make money from recorded music.\u201d Nash explains that touring comes with a whole raft of costs, such as renting a tour bus, paying for a band and crew, food, petrol, hotels. Streaming was \u201cbuilt unethically from the start\u201d, she says, with major labels and streaming services defining the terms and conditions \u2013 not artists \u2013 and not updating pre-streaming contracts to reflect the new reality. \u201cWho you listen to isn\u2019t where your money directly goes, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. The way the music industry has been structured, historically, has been exploiting artists. And we\u2019ve been exploited yet again.\u201d Nash has personal experience of the shadier side of the business. Her former managermisappropriated large amountsof her money during the mid-2010s. (They reached an out-of-court settlement.) During a lengthy legal battle, Nash had to move back in with her parents. \u201cIt was a really difficult thing for me to experience,\u201d she says. \u201cBut overall I think it\u2019s informed me, and I feel capable of speaking on issues like this now. I feel really empathetic to artists \u2013 it\u2019s made me aware of how toxic the environment is.\u201d The decision to sell her pictures online drew criticism, with people accusing Nash of being a bad influence on young girls. \u201cI\u2019m a fantastic influence for young girls,\u201d she counters. \u201cI\u2019ve fought my entire career for young women \u2013 representation is extremely important to me.\u201d The photos were also a way of taking control of her sexuality. As an actor on Netflix series Glow, \u201cI\u2019ve been naked on TV,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve simulated a threesome. I use my body all the time on stage to move, to sing, to connect with an audience. But if I\u2019m completely in control of it, that\u2019s \u2018wrong\u2019. Is it wrong? Our bodies are so politicised, and the world has an opinion about how to prevent us from being able to make choices about them.\u201d Last weekend, Nash premiered Germ at the Mighty Hoopla festival along with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Later this month she will headline Glastonbury\u2019s Left Field stage on the Saturday night. She is excited to play the song in front of an audience: \u201cI think that will be quite a punk, exciting moment in the set.\u201d Nash is undeterred by the internet noise the song has caused. \u201cI mean, sure, attack me online, but I\u2019m still right,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to leave a record in musical history of a feminist who is outspoken as a cis woman: this is my opinion, and I don\u2019t want the loudest cultural voice in the room to be anti-trans. That is not what feminism has taught me.\u201d",

        "raw_text": "Glastonbury festival has announced its full lineup of over 3,000 performances between 25 and 29 June, adding a number of new artists to the main stages along with timings and a series of tantalising secret sets. Installed in a plum spot at 6.15pm on the Pyramid stage on Saturday night, after John Fogerty and before Raye and Neil Young, is an act called Patchwork \u2013 unlikely to be the \u201calternative country fusion\u201d band from British Columbia or Tennessee\u2019s \u201coccult emotional hardcore\u201d outfit of the same name. In 2023, Glastonbury hosted a similarly unheard-of band called the Churnups playing on the Pyramid stage, who ended up being Foo Fighters. Glastonbury organisers said they would not provide any further information about Patchwork. There are also \u201cto be announced\u201d slots on late afternoon Friday on the Pyramid stage, Friday morning on the Woodsies stage (which has previously hosted secret sets from Kasabian and the Killers) and Saturday evening on the Park stage (Pulp and Jack White have been secret guests there in the past). Over on the Tree stage, a previously announced artist listed with a seemingly random stream of glyphs is likely to be Four Tet, who curates a Spotify playlist under the same name. New artist additions to the Other stage include drum\u2019n\u2019bass legends Fabio & Grooverider opening on Friday, playing tracks in symphonic arrangements with the Outlook Orchestra, plus pop artists Rizzle Kicks and Good Neighbours, and singer-songwriters Nadine Shah and Louis Dunford. Glass Beams and Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso are among those added to West Holts, whileJalen Ngonda,Ichiko Aoba,Horsegirl,John GlacierandGeordie Greepjoin other new names on the Park stage. Most of the other big stages had already announced their full lineups \u2013 including a range of Hollywood names doing Q&As and talks at thePilton Palais cinema, namely Margot Robbie, Paul Mescal, Andrew Garfield, Tilda Swinton, Ncuti Gatwa, Jodie Comer, Taron Egerton, Edgar Wright and Jesse Armstrong. Actor Dominic West and TV presenter Alice Roberts will dispense wisdom at the Free University of Glastonbury, while debaters at the Speakers Forum include MPs Ellie Chowns and Clive Lewis, plus names such as Dale Vince, Asif Kapadia and Owen Jones. And there is the usual range of WTF-provoking artist names further down the bill, this year including Twat Union, Psycho-Acoustic Goat, Spambiguous Intentions, Formidable Vegetable, DJ Fart Eater doing a back-to-back set with DJ Stink Bomb, and an experience entitled Oedipussi: Choose Your Own Drag Adventure. Glastonbury organisers have also announced details for a series of events to open the festival, including a rare Wednesday night event on the Pyramid stage entitled Look to the Skies. This is the first theatre and circus show on the Pyramid since 1990, involving \u201ca breathtaking aerial odyssey, with high wire walkers, acrobats and incredible circus performances\u201d. It will complement the usual opening ceremony at the Green Fields, where a \u201cflame of hope\u201d, made up of \u201c15 sacred flames from around the world\u201d will be \u201chonoured with a thousand voices who will unite in a powerful mantra for Peace to create a collective sense of unity, love, and purpose\u201d, concluding in a firework display. Then, on Thursday afternoon at 12.30pm, \u201cthe Green Fields ask you to join them in the Sacred Space to create the Biggest Mantra for Peace ever seen at Glastonbury festival \u2013 to demonstrate compassion and solidarity with those living in conflict and create a moment of reflection and celebration of peace, hope and unity\u201d. Ticketholders will now pore over the lineup to spot any big clashes, including two of the most talked-about names in global pop: Charli xcx and Doechii, playing on different stages at the same time on Saturday night. Plenty of eyes will be on the West Holts stage at 4pm on Saturday, for Kneecap. There have been calls in some quarters for the punkish Northern Ireland rap-rave trio to be pulled from the lineup, after footage emerged of them allegedly saying \u201cthe only good Tory is a dead Tory\u201d and \u201cup Hamas, up Hezbollah\u201d. Commons leader and cabinet minister Lucy Powell said in parliament: \u201cI\u2019m sure that no-one in this House would want to see them playing at Glastonbury\u201d. The group\u2019s Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh was latercharged with a terrorism offence, with Met police saying he aroused \u201creasonable suspicion that he is a supporter of a proscribed organisation\u201d. He is due in court on 18 June. The group have already been axed fromGlasgow\u2019s TRNSMT festival, but an appearance atLondon\u2019s Wide Awake festivalwent ahead.

        "raw_text": "Organisers ofEdinburghfringe events have been urged to be \u201cpretty smart\u201d and capitalise on the decision by Oasis and AC/DC to play gigs in the city midway through the festival. There was surprise and irritation when it emerged the bands would be staging four concerts at Murrayfield stadium in mid-August when the world\u2019s largest arts festival is in full flow. Tony Lankester, who recently took over as the Fringe Society\u2019s chief executive, said fringe companies should see the concerts as an opportunity rather than fret about downsides. About 75,000 fans are expected for each concert \u2013 three by Oasis and one by AC/DC, putting the city\u2019s trains, buses and trams under even greater strain, with visitors competing for alreadyscarce and expensive hotel beds. Lankester, who previously ran South Africa\u2019s national arts festival, said fringe venues should tempt Edinburgh residents who may \u201cwant to hide\u201d when the concerts take place with discounted tickets or free wine. Venues could also tempt Oasis andAC/DCconcertgoers with \u201cmorning after\u201d performances in the city with free bacon rolls and coffee, he suggested. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to happen is for the local audience to hide that night,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some pretty smart marketing type things that I think venues could be looking at. The fact is that it\u2019s not going away. Why not be completely opportunistic about it?\u201d This year\u2019s fringe, which runs from 1 to 25 Augustand takes place alongside the international festival and book festival, is expected to involve about 50,000 performances at 265 venues. Lankester said the strength of the programme, which includes themes such as rebellious women, the apocalypse, queer joy and rave culture, showed artists were as hungry as ever to perform despite global crises and tensions. \u201cWhat excites me most about the programme, is the signal that it sends is of an industry in healthy shape,\u201d he said. For the first time, five shows from US performers are being underwritten by donors to theKeep it Fringefunding strand launched in 2023 by the Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the fringe\u2019s honorary president, to support new, marginalised or innovative acts. Lankester said he had numerous conversations that \u201creaffirmed for me what I knew coming into this job, that there\u2019s a lot of love and joy around the fringe. It\u2019s something that people absolutely want to preserve, protect, engage with, be part of. It\u2019s still on an incredible number of people\u2019s bucket lists.\u201d He said he was talking to major brands about the potential to become headline sponsors of the fringe for the first time, to bring in extra revenue for performers and venues at a time of intense pressure on public funding. He said those discussions were at an early stage, but indicated it could involve a bank or beer brand. No sponsor would be allowed to rebrand the fringe, but their investments would help the festival to improve its finances. Sign up toThe Guide Get our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every Friday after newsletter promotion In her last newspaper interview, Shona McCarthy, Lankester\u2019s immediate predecessor,accused political leaders of consistently neglecting the fringeand failing to adequately invest in services, transport and infrastructure such as mobile phone services. Lankester said he \u201cstood by\u201d everything McCarthy had said. Her \u201cenormously valuable\u201d intervention had fuelled action and more responsiveness in the council, the Scottish government and other agencies, he said, adding: \u201cThe message landed.\u201d Lankester is lobbying Edinburgh council to devote at least \u00a31.1m of a new visitor levy on hotel beds to supporting the festival, and is in talks about strengthening the city\u2019s ailing mobile and wifi services, as well as improved rail services for non-residents. The visitor levy will come into force in July 2026, but hotels will begin collecting it on all bookings made from October this year. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to happen is for that money to sort of disappear into a black hole and for no benefit to be felt by the people [who] drive a big chunk of that revenue,\u201d he said.",

        "raw_text": "Warm, buttery, golden and unapologetically alliumy, garlic bread is the side dish that steals the show. In our house, it\u2019s a non-negotiable part of pizza and movie nights and the first thing to disappear, usually long before the film has started. It\u2019s on the table when we eat spaghetti, on hand to dunk intopumpkin soup, and sometimes snatched straight off the baking tray. It\u2019s simple, cheap and makes people happy. To find the best supermarket garlic breads, I gathered my partner, my three-year-old daughter and a carb-loving friend and put us through a blind taste test of 12 different loaves, baking each according to the packet instructions. We judged each one on four things: how garlicky it was, its butteriness, the flavour of the bread and its texture (soft inside, crusty outside). We dished out extra points if a loaf tasted like real garlic or included herbs that enhanced the flavour. After trying garlic bread in every conceivable form \u2013 from individual slices to whole loaves \u2013 we learned which felt like home, and which felt like homework. La Famiglia Kitchen Stone BakedGarlicBaguette: 400g, $6.50 ($1.63 per 100g), available from Coles Score: 8.5/10 With its glossy crust and soft, steamy centre, this loaf looked as if it had been shaped by hand (possibly by angels). The butter was spot-on: rich but not greasy, and appealingly soaked into the warm bread, with a perfect amount of saltiness in the bread and the butter. \u201cThe garlic tastes really natural and vibrant,\u201d one taster said, although we all agreed we would have loved a little more punch. The garlic might\u2019ve held back, but none of us did when it came to arguing over the last slice. World Kitchen Homestyle Garlic Bread: 450g, $2.09 ($0.46 per 100g), available from Aldi Score: 7.5/10 If any garlic bread in this test could ward off the undead, it\u2019s this one. \u201cA vampire would burst into flames just smelling it,\u201d said one enthusiastic taster. Generously flecked with real garlic and packing the boldest flavour of the bunch, this one fully committed. It looked like your classic pizza-night loaf, although the crust lacked the crunch of some competitors and the butter wasn\u2019t quite as rich. Still, the bread was full of flavour and the lingering garlicky aftertaste was just right. A very strong performance from the cheapest of the bunch. Global Bakehouse Value Garlic Bread: 450g, $2.10 ($0.47 per 100g), available from Woolworths Score: 6.5/10 This one channelled the classic pizza chain version \u2013 you know the one \u2013 with pillowy bread and a slightly artificial garlic kick. We watched my daughter pull the soft insides away from the crusts, just as we\u2019d done as kids, and instinctively followed suit. Sadly, the butter coverage was uneven, with some slices swimming and others just dotted with the good stuff. \u201cThis is so nostalgic,\u201d one taster said. \u201cBut at the same time, I don\u2019t want to eat more than one slice.\u201d Not bad, but never a contender for the crown. Senza Gluten & Dairy Free Garlic Bread: 250g, $4.50 ($1.80 per 100g), available from Woolworths and Coles Score: 6.5/10 With a golden crust, soft crumb and a generous scattering of herbs and garlic, this gluten-free entrant definitely looked the part. The texture wasn\u2019t quite as springy, but it also wasn\u2019t dry or crumbly \u2013 a minor miracle in the gluten-free bread world. \u201cThere are definite garlic bread vibes,\u201d said one taster. \u201cThey\u2019re just \u2026 quiet.\u201d The flavours didn\u2019t roar, but this was a nicely seasoned bite with a subtle savouriness. La Famiglia Kitchen Traditional Garlic Bread: 400g, $5 ($1.25 per 100g), available from Woolworths Score: 6/10 First impressions were promising: a full loaf split lengthways, each half buttered and generously flecked with herbs. \u201cThis is the garlic bread in my head when I picture fancy garlic bread,\u201d said one hopeful taster. Sadly, the flavour didn\u2019t quite back it up. The butter stayed in a thin, shy layer that didn\u2019t seep into the bread, and the garlic was more of a rumour than a presence. It wasn\u2019t unpleasant, just underwhelming. Sign up toSaved for Later Catch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tips after newsletter promotion La Famiglia Kitchen Garlic Bread: 250g, $2.95 ($1.18 per 100g), available from Woolworths and Coles Score: 6/10 La Famiglia Kitchen seems to make garlic bread in every imaginable shape, from a rustic ciabatta to the baguette that topped our list. This one, a classic vertically sliced loaf format, wasn\u2019t bad, but threw us with a weird sweetness we didn\u2019t notice in their other offerings. \u201cIs this dessert?\u201d one taster asked. The texture was fine, the garlic taste modest. Strangely, our three-year-old ranked it near the bottom, and she\u2019s usually very forgiving when carbs are involved. Coles Simply Garlic Bread: 450g, $2.10 ($0.47 per 100g), available from Coles Score: 5/10 This was the garlic bread equivalent of background music: pleasant, familiar and entirely forgettable. The loaf had a decent texture and looked the part, but the garlic barely showed up. It\u2019d do a respectable job sopping up the leftover sauce on a plate of spaghetti, but you won\u2019t be dreaming about it later. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of bread you eat without realising you\u2019re eating it,\u201d said one taster, mid-chew. Coles Kitchen Garlic Baguette: 450g, $3.20 ($0.71 per 100g), available from Coles Score: 5/10 Like the cover model for a garlic bread magazine, this entrant was glossy, golden and ready for its closeup. One bite revealed the bread\u2019s pleasantly soft texture, but then came the butter. So much butter. Our slices teetered on the edge of soggy, like they\u2019d been luxuriating in a butter spa rather than being gently spread with it. \u201cIt tastes like garlic bread you\u2019d get at a fast-food place,\u201d said one taster, wiping butter from their mouth in between bites. There was also a slightly artificial edge to the flavour, but in a nostalgic, junk-food kind of way. Weirdly enjoyable, if a bit too enthusiastic with the grease. La Famiglia Kitchen Garlic Slices: 270g, $6.50 ($2.41 per 100g), available from Woolworths and Coles Score: 4.5/10 We all have our favourite style of garlic bread. Some are loyal to the soft, foil-wrapped loaves that come with home-delivered pizza. Others swear by individually browned slices, each one golden and crisp. This fell into the second camp, but didn\u2019t quite make it. Although we followed the packet instructions, the centimetre-thick slices came out of the oven dry and biscuity. With only one side buttered, the flavour wasn\u2019t as big as we wanted. \u201cIt\u2019s got the same saltiness as cinema popcorn,\u201d one taster said. Appealing, but more a butter-flavoured cracker than a piece of garlic bread. Woolworths Free From Gluten Garlic Bread: 250g, $4.50 ($1.80 per 100g), available from Woolworths Score: 4/10 This one didn\u2019t fool anyone: even before the gluten-free label was revealed after the test, tasters had their suspicions. The missing crust was a clue, and although the texture inside was OK, one bite made it clear that something was different here. \u201cIt has a weird flavour, like I can taste the packet,\u201d one taster said. My three-year-old took one sniff and backed away. Texture aside, there was barely any butter and only a whisper of garlic. A garlic bread in theory only. Woolworths Garlic Bread Slices: 270g, $3.30 ($1.22 per 100g), available from Woolworths Score: 4/10 Our three-year-old quickly declared this the winner and tried to eat all the slices we\u2019d toasted, but the rest of us were less impressed. The bread was fine: crisp and golden on top, soft below with a decent texture throughout. But the garlic? Completely MIA. Even the butter was barely there. If you\u2019re after nostalgia, comfort \u2013 or actual garlic \u2013 this won\u2019t hit the spot. If you\u2019re three and thrilled to be handed a piece of buttered toast, it\u2019s a triumph. World Kitchen Garlic Bread: 270g, $2.99 ($1.11 per 100g), available from Aldi Score: 3/10 This one looked like garlic bread made for a TV commercial: shiny, uniformly shaped and suspiciously perfect. Unfortunately, it also tasted like prop food. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone sprinkled garlic salt in my mouth,\u201d said one horrified taster. Another agreed: \u201cNo nonna went anywhere near this.\u201d Both butter and garlic had an unnerving artificial vibe, with none of the depth of the real thing, and it left a lingering chemical aftertaste. More science experiment than side dish, and weird given Aldi almost took out top spot with its much cheaper version. ",

        "raw_text": "Winter is all about citrus, says owner and buyer Josh Flamminio at Sydney\u2019s Galluzzo Fruiterers. \u201cNavel oranges are in. They\u2019re from Mildura and they\u2019re getting sweeter.\u201dAt $3 a kilo in supermarkets, they\u2019re closely followed by mandarins. Daisy, imperial and Premium Gem varieties are also at their peak. \u201cA Premium Gem mandarin is a new one in our shop,\u201d says Flamminio. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the perfect amount of tang, with a few seeds. They\u2019re a rounded, symmetrical mandarin.\u201d At Melbourne\u2019s Happy Apple, senior buyer Graham Gee has his eye on Cara Cara oranges, which will arrive this month. They\u2019re seedless and known for their sweet flavour. Grapefruits are in season too, and can be found for about $5 a kilo in supermarkets. Berries, however, have faltered. \u201cBlueberries are quite diabolical at the moment. They\u2019re in really short supply,\u201d says Gee. \u201cThey are out of season and affected by the weather. You\u2019re looking at double-figure price tags for anything that is half decent, which is tough.\u201d Blueberries are expected to fall in price in another three to four weeks, but it\u2019s not all blue. In Queensland, strawberries and raspberries are kicking off, with strawberries soon to come down to $2 or $3 a punnet. But the best crop to make a comeback is Hass avocados. \u201cYou\u2019ll see some for a couple of dollars apiece, great multi-buy deals, and the quality is really good. We\u2019ve got such an appetite for them,\u201d says Gee. At a couple of dollars a bunch, depending on size and quality, Flamminio says there is plenty of cavolo nero, silverbeet, kale and cabbage and all unaffected by the rain. \u201cPeople are doing lots of soups and stews and bakes. They\u2019re very affordable and wintry. Silverbeet is humongous. They\u2019re almost a metre long, and gorgeous.\u201d We all know silverbeet can wilt down to nothing, but it is front and centre in a Yotam Ottolenghi southIndian and Sri Lankan inspired stir-fry, or you can stuff theenormous leaves with rice, herbs and spices.Pumpkins are in their prime, at $2 a kilo or less in grocers and supermarkets. \u201cThey\u2019re not green any more, they\u2019re sun-kissed and bright orange,\u201d says Flamminio. Butternut, Jap or Queensland blue pumpkin are all available, says Gee. Sweet potatoes and potatoes are also filling shelves, at $3.50 to $4.50 a kilo, respectively. We can expect to see reasonable prices throughout the rest of winter. Make use of citrus and the best orange-coloured veg in Alice Zaslavsky\u2019s one-trayroast pumpkin, sweet potato and carrot soup. Brussels sprouts are also budding, but haven\u2019t quite reached their cheapest. Flamminio says they can be as low as $3.99 a kilo at their peak. He recommends rhubarb too. The crops are a rich red, with thick stalks \u2013 perfect for dessert. Ravneet Gill has apicture-perfect tartthat shows off the pink, plus a twist onrhubarb and custard with tapioca. Or you can go back to basics and spruce up a bowl of porridge withNigel Slater\u2019s rhubarb addition. After cold weather and the cyclone damage, tomatoes are not looking rosy. \u201cThis is the worst I\u2019ve seen in four years,\u201d says Flamminio, . \u201cI\u2019ve got them for $10.99 a kilo in my shop because I can\u2019t justify asking people to pay $14.99. People could be charging $16 to $18 a kilo to make a margin. For the next three or four weeks, hold on to your hat for tomatoes.\u201d Cucumbers are more expensive, even compared with three or four weeks ago, and grocers are still waiting for red capsicums to kick in within the month, after rain in Queensland slowed supply.

I have earned this perplexed look by exhibiting basic courtesy \u2013 moving my backpack to my front in order to avoid jostling other commuters. Shortly after this eyeball exchange, she bangs into my hip with her ludicrously capacious handbag. In almost all ways, the metro has changed my life for the better. It has slightly lengthened my walking commute, while significantly shortening my time on mass transit. And yet, every morning, I am faced with frustration. People crowd the entryways, making it difficult to shuffle deeper into the aisles. On packed carriages, we fail to file to the sides, forcing fellow riders to fight their way to the doors upon departure. These breaches of etiquette would earn you filthy looks in London or Paris, and verbal chastisement in New York. In Singapore, frustrated passengers could simply point to a sign above their heads, telling commuters what not to do. While no city has solved the problem of manspreading, in Sydney we contend with bag spreading too. Passengers dump their belongings on the seats beside them, even when others are standing. Worse still, I\u2019ve seen bags sprawled across the floor. This trip hazard would be warned against any in OH&S handbook. Why should our ride to work be any different? I hear from colleagues in Melbourne that trams are plagued by this issue too. This all gives me a major case of cultural cringe, because bag spreading isn\u2019t a problem for our international visitors. I love to hear other languages spoken on the metro, but I love to see backpacks placed on laps and suitcases tucked between legs even more. I appreciate that not every passenger is lucky enough to have experienced commutes in other countries. So patronising as it may be, I want our expanding public infrastructure to come with an education campaign. A few Singapore-style signs would not go astray. But in the meantime, we\u2019re embarrassing ourselves in front of the tourists.",

I was only 13 years old and, when you first start menstruating, you never know when your next period is going to arrive. I was away on holiday with my family, playing in the hotel pool with some new friends I\u2019d just met. There was definitely a boy there I fancied. At one point I hopped out of the pool and suddenly this lifeguard, who must have only been 15 or 16 himself, walked straight up, put a towel around me and said really quietly in my ear, \u201cYou need to go to the bathroom.\u201d I looked down and realised why: my period had started. That was it. He said nothing more. Not even my twin sister, who was also in the pool, had any idea what had happened. He was that subtle about it. If he hadn\u2019t done that, it probably would have destroyed my entire holiday. You can just imagine the humiliation of having met a group of cool teenagers you\u2019re trying to impress and suddenly you\u2019ve got blood running down your legs. This was the 1980s \u2013 they would have pointed at me and laughed! I will always be grateful to that lifeguard. I\u2019ve always wished that I could go online and find this boy to thank him \u2013 or thank his mother more than anything, as she clearly taught him perfect manners.

        "raw_text": "Daniel and I went to the same high school in Melbourne. He was a year older than me, and we must have passed each other thousands of times, but I have no memory of ever talking to him. We knew of each other, but we didn\u2019t know each other\u2019s names. We met properly for the first time at a pre-drinks when I was in my first year of university. He was holding a six-pack of beer and looked vaguely familiar. I introduced myself, he offered me one of his drinks and we got talking. Not long after, we started dating. We\u2019d walk on the beach in St Kildatogether, cook meals and grab coffee whenever we could. It was simple, easy and just felt right. I quickly realised Daniel and I could dive deep into a shared passion of ours \u2013 Australian politics \u2013 without it ever turning into a fight. At the time, I was studying politics as part of my arts/law degree, and Daniel had been a member of the Labor party since he was 16. In Daniel, I found someone who spoke the same language and shared similar values. Politics wasn\u2019t the sole foundation of our relationship, but when something big happened, we weren\u2019t shy about debating it. While we were still at university, Daniel landed a job working for a politician. I decided to copy him, and I emailed every member of parliament in Victoria until one of them offered me a role. If he could do it, so could I. We pushed each other forward like that, and we still do. When Daniel decided to run for federal parliament at just 21, I campaigned with him every step of the way. We door-knocked together and handed out his flyers. People would do a double take when they met him, looking at his scuffed Converse sneakers. He ran in a safe Liberal seat, against a candidate who later became Australia\u2019s trade minister. Slim chances didn\u2019t bother Daniel, though. He ran for office because he had the time and believed in the cause. I remember being so proud of him for trying his best, even in the face of great odds. The night of the election, we hung out and watched the results roll in live on TV. Daniel was exhausted after handing out how-to-vote cards all day, and we both knew he\u2019d lost. Despite that, he still had a big smile on his face, and in that moment, I knew this was my guy. I felt so moved watching how much Daniel gave of himself \u2013 not for praise, but because he truly cared. It was one of those quiet, powerful moments. When I ran for parliament, years later, Daniel returned the favour. He hung my posters around our neighbourhood and helped me letterbox. When the votes were counted and I didn\u2019t win, he knew exactly what to say, because he\u2019d been there too. We\u2019ve been married for a decade now and have five kids together. Despite the chaos of our busy life, Daniel and I regularly have animated discussions about what\u2019s going on in the country. Our garage is still a jumble of old campaign signs wedged between prams and half-empty tins of paint. The kids sometimes drag one out, asking if we really did run for parliament and if we won. We laugh, because that was never the point. For us, politics is about trying to make Australia a better place. These days, we\u2019re more likely to be caring for our children than campaigning, but the ideas that motivated us back then still drive us. We did it for the children we were dreaming of, and now we\u2019re raising them. Do you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

Sat by the fire, he addresses his students. \u201cThis is not a wellness retreat. It is about getting out of your comfort zone.\u201d I am in the Camden bush, on Dharawal and Gundungurra Country, for a four-day wilderness survival course taught by the consultant forTV\u2019s most gruelling show, Alone Australia. On the itinerary: knife work, knots, emergency shelters, fire lighting, water collection, plant identification, solar and celestial navigation, plus emergency signalling and rescue techniques. On my person: fresh hiking boots, gold hoops, perfectly low-rise cargo pants and a black tee. The last time I went camping was with school in year 9, in a tent set up about 50 steps from a cabin. Out of my comfort zone, indeed \u2013 this time I don\u2019t have a tent, or a toilet. After a short hike, we arrive at sunset to a large green tarp billowing gently. It\u2019s a military parachute, Dedman tells us. We gather at a semicircle of stools beneath the canopy. Dedman gets straight to it. The goal of \u201csurvival\u201d is to be found, he says.

Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Dedman\u2019s philosophy about the land and people\u2019s role on it is clear just a few hours in: \u201cOur existence here is based on the caring capacity of the Earth. \u201cBut we live in a system of expanding expenditure \u2026 at total odds with nature. Something is very broken with our system.\u201d We go around the circle of 15 students, introducing ourselves. Most of us are novices, mainly Sydney and Canberra-based men with office jobs looking to reconnect with the outdoors (participant Julian Carrick says he is here to \u201csoothe the soul\u201d and \u201csee the stars\u201d) plus two parents, their eager sons and myself. Some students have dabbled in survival and bushcraft for years \u2013 including Karla Pound, a National Geographic expedition leader and contestant on the current season of Alone. We\u2019re not equipped for when things go wrong, she tells me. She says even during common occurrences such as power outages and floods, \u201cpeople don\u2019t know the first thing to do\u201d. \u201cIt is really important to have these basic, fundamental skills under your belt.\u201d The parachute tarp becomes our base for the next four days, with classes held early in the morning and late at night. These hours are by design, to simulate the exhaustion and distraction one might feel in a real survival situation. Meanwhile our days are structured around practical skills. First, knives (I\u2019m limp-wristed and slow), then knots (I actually catch on). We use both to set up our first emergency shelters \u2013 pitched plastic sheets strung up between two trees and secured with pegs we carved ourselves, totally open to the surrounds. These structures are called hootchies. I am slow to find a spot \u2013 too picky, terrified of sleeping near thick shrubbery. It\u2019s a justified fear, I\u2019d say, given we are in the habitat of funnel web spiders, king brown and red belly black snakes. By the time I choose a location, the sun is setting. I fumble in the dark, trying to hold all my ropes and pegs in place. It is only thanks to kind peers \u2013 a physio and a former-detective-turned-teacher \u2013 that I am able to set up in time for dinner. \u201cThe western world has a problem with food aversion,\u201d Dedman says at meal time. So true. I\u2019m hungry for the potato cooking under the bonfire coals we are sitting around. We waste so much, he says, we\u2019re disconnected from our food\u2019s sources. I nod when he mentions more sustainable protein alternatives to beef. Then he brings out a container of live meal worms. We are going to eat them, he says. I laugh. Classic Dedman! My head torch lights up the plump, yellow bodies writhing in the container and visceral anxiety floods my stomach. \u201cFussy people die.\u201dAfter several failed attempts, I get the worms into my mouth. They wriggle around my fingers. They thrash against my lips. They burst between my teeth, and the group applauds. I actually enjoy the taste. This will forever be my greatest feat. I am overcome with relief! But Dedman has leftovers. I was too hesitant, he tells me. I can will myself to do anything, he says. Eat more.

I realise if I\u2019m actually caught out in the bush I\u2019ll likely perish because I can\u2019t catch, behead and eat a cricket. An instructor does it for me. Ever since being attacked by a swarm of seagulls on a beach, I\u2019ve been a little jumpy around animals. I start overthinking my impending night\u2019s sleep \u2013 what if I wake up to a snake in my sleeping bag? But on a midnight walk to learn celestial navigation before bed, my thoughts are interrupted when we turn off our torches and look up. The air is crisp, the surrounds are silent and the sky glimmers. Fear is replaced by cool, calm peace. I have a great night\u2019s sleep. The next day we learn to make fire with our knife and a ferro rod, and purify creek water. While learning about local flora on a bush walk, Dedman throws impromptu challenges at us \u2013 five minutes to gather tinder and kindle and start a fire. All this skill-building has been working us up to the task of our third night \u2013 finding an ally or two, scoping out a safe spot and setting up an emergency base. I turn to my new friends Daniel and Damien and we set off, racing against our faux competition who have their sights set on the same campsite. We string up our reflective blankets at a tilt between two trees, light a fire, filter our creek water and prepare a hearty meal of kangaroo stew. We eat and chat beneath the night sky and I start to feel a little sad. This place is so beautiful and tomorrow I have to go home. \u201cI mean, just look around you,\u201d Carrick, a peer on the course, said earlier in the day. \u201cThis place is heaven right here. You don\u2019t need to look any further.\u201d Dedman\u2019s lessons differ depending on the environment. Here are a few general takeaways for when you are lost or stranded. Mindset is important. Panic is dangerous and can affect those around you. You need to be able to plan, act and hold the will to live. Make sure you think throughyour survival priorities. The rule of threes is governed by what will harm you first: you can survive just three minutes without air, three days without water and three weeks without food. Follow the PLAN acronym: protection (first aid, clothing, shelter, fire), location (attracting, holding and directing attention), acquisition (of water, then food) and navigation (orientation, travel, direction). When going anywhere remote, ensure you can be found. Have a satellite communication device like an EPIRB (emergency position-indicating radiobeacon) on you. Also take stock of everything you have that can attract attention in the natural environment \u2013 shiny, bright and reflective materials. You can set these up between trees as a method of passive signalling, fly a bright flag at the end of a big stick, or make a ground-to-air sign with letters. \u201cV\u201d is the international emergency distress symbol. A ground to air sign has to be 6m x 3m to be seen by a passing aerial vehicle or satellite. Search efforts are conducted in patterns. Aircraft will do a box search at the height they can see an animal move. A ground search will follow a track, a river, or man-made things such as telecommunication towers and windmills. Contour searches of mountains are conducted by circling. If you know these patterns, you can set your signalling to capitalise on where you will most likely be seen.
