    "raw_text": "Interim Matildas coach Tom Sermanni has delivered a scathing critique of the A-League Women competition's professionalism, stating that Australian football remains \"grossly underinvested\" in the women's game. That the league is not yet fully professional is particularly \"irritating\" for Sermanni, given the blockbuster success of the 2023 Women's World Cup. Arsenal's Matildas trio \u2014 Caitlin Foord, Steph Catley and Kyra Cooney-Cross \u2014 are celebrating after the English giants toppled Barcelona 1-0 to claim the UEFA Women's Champions League title. Every player in the Matildas squad has played in the ALW at some point, including six players currently in the domestic league. But on Thursday, women's football stalwart Sermanni, typically a happy-go-lucky character, unleashed both barrels. \"We really need to have, at A-League level, a real rethink,\" he said. \"The league has been going for 17 years. When we started the league, and the coaches came from our institute programs, we had full-time coaches and more full-time staff than we have now, 17 years in. \"The A-League separated five years ago and what we have done since then is we've got home and away, which is an improvement, but we are still grossly under-invested in the women's game here. \"I don't know if there's a thought process going forward about where they want to take the league or what they want to do. But there's a huge amount of work that actually needs to be done. We put the spotlight on women making a big impact on and off the field in the sporting world \u2014 from the grassroots through to the elite level. \"It's even more irritating when you think how we had the most successful World Cup ever two years ago, and A-League Women are in the situation that they're in now, it's just not good enough.\" The ALW, formerly W-League, started in 2008. \"At that time, our league was the forefront of women's leagues, to be perfectly honest,\" Sermanni said. \"It's still very important, and coaches, staffs and players are doing exceptionally well. But the league itself is in need of significant improvement in its professionalism. \"There are three clubs that are suitably staffed \u2014 that's Melbourne City, Melbourne Victory and Wellington Phoenix. And the rest of the clubs are completely inadequately staffed. \"Players get 35-week contracts now. \"A league has just started in Canada \u2014 football-wise, we're well in advance of Canada \u2014 where the base salary is twice what our basic salary is, where there's full-time staff, full-time players. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines. \"And we are still trying to produce players when we have a space of three months where the club has got no contact, no control, no reference point for the players, to actually keep them and know what's happening.\" Professional Footballers Australia has warned of the potential for a \"player drain\" from the ALW and its effect on developing Matildas if the league isn't fully professionalised. CEO Beau Busch reiterated that it needed to happen by the 2026-27 season to capitalise on next year's Asian Cup. \"Setting that as our target and achieving it will prevent us falling further behind as global standards continue to rise at pace,\" he said. The Australian Professional Leagues have been contacted for comment. In Canada's Northern Super League, where new call-up Kahli Johnson plays, the minimum wage is $56,000, more than double the ALW's $26,000, with a salary cap of $1.8 million compared to $600,000. Sermanni will coach the Matildas for the 150th time across three stints in Friday night's clash with Argentina at Marvel Stadium, with Central Coast's Emily Husband and Western United's Kat Smith among his assistants. Arsenal trio Steph Catley, Caitlin Foord and Kyra Cooney-Cross are unlikely to start after only arriving in camp on Wednesday night following their Women's Champions League triumph. AAP",

    "raw_text": "NSW great Andrew Johns has called for Queensland captain Daly Cherry-Evans to be axed and replaced by Tom Dearden at halfback ahead of State of Origin II. Watching the Maroons run around Lang Park in Origin Game I, you would swear this team met for the first time a few days ago, rather than experienced campaigners who have seen it all. Cherry-Evans, the oldest player in Origin history at 36, was below his best in his 26th match for the Maroons,who went down 18-6 in the series opener in Brisbane on Wednesday night. Johns said it was time for Dearden, who played off the bench in Origin I, to replace Cherry-Evans. \"No-one beats Father Time \u2026 I think they have to pull the trigger and bring Dearden in,\" Johns said on the Nine Network. \" I don't know where the improvement comes with this group. Maroons skipper Daly Cherry-Evans may face the axe before Origin II in Perth.(AAP: Dave Hunt) \"NSW, if they were on tonight, they win by 40 or 50 (points). They left so many tries out there and they'll be better for that. \"I don't know if they can go up another level, Queensland. I think there has to be changes.\" Former Maroons skipper Cameron Smith also weighed in on Cherry-Evans's Origin future. But Smith made it clear Maroons coach Billy Slater would be the crucial voice at the selection table. \"I think Billy will have that discussion with his selection panel and he'll go through this game thoroughly,\" Smith said. \"There's no doubt that the key position players of Queensland lacked a bit of cohesion tonight. \"In the crucial moments of the game they just couldn't get the job done.\" Origin II will be played in Perth on June 18.

    "raw_text": "Warning: This story contains details of sexual abuse and domestic violence. A former top aide to Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has testified that the hip-hop mogul threatened to kill her during her first day on the job and waved a gun as he kidnapped her years later in an angry rush to find and kill rapper Kid Cudi. Capricorn Clark's account of Mr Combs's volatility and violence on Tuesday launched the third week of testimony at the singer's Manhattan federal sex trafficking trial. Prosecutors called Ms Clark, the former global brand director for Mr Combs's Bad Boy Entertainment, to support a charge that he led a two-decade racketeering conspiracy that relied on beefy bodyguards, death threats and the silence of frightened staff to ensure he got what he wanted. Mr Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to an indictment alleging he abused his longtime girlfriend, R&B singer Cassie, and others. If convicted, he could face 15 years to life in prison. Ms Clark's tearful testimony came days after Kid Cudi, whose legal name is Scott Mescudi, testified that Ms Clark called him from a car outside his home in December 2011 and told him Mr Combs had forced her to accompany him to Mr Mescudi's house. Rapper Kid Cudi arrives to testify at the Diddy trial in Manhattan on May 22.(Reuters: David 'Dee' Delgado) Mr Combs was angry that Mr Mescudi was dating Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, Ms Clark said. Ms Clark, referring to Mr Combs as \"Puff\" after his former stage name, Puff Daddy, said he came to her home holding a gun and demanded she get dressed because \"we're going to kill Cudi\". Her voice shaky, Ms Clark recounted how they rode in a black Cadillac Escalade to Mr Mescudi's Los Angeles home, where Mr Combs and his bodyguard entered the residence while Ms Clark sat in the SUV and called Ms Ventura. Ms Clark testified she told Ms Ventura that Mr Combs \"got me with a gun and brought me to Cudi's house to kill him\". Ms Clark said she heard Mr Mescudi in the background asking: \"He's in my house?\" She said she told Ms Ventura, \"Stop him, he's going to get himself killed\". Ms Ventura told her she could not stop Mr Mescudi, she recalled. Mr Combs returned to the Escalade and asked Ms Clark who she was talking to, she said, then grabbed the phone and called Ms Ventura back. They next heard Mr Mescudi driving up the road, Ms Clark said. Mr Combs and his bodyguard got back in the SUV and chased after Mr Mescudi, finally giving up when they passed police cars that were heading to Mr Mescudi's house. Disgraced hip-hop mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs always knew how to attract attention but he probably never anticipated the circus that now surrounds him at his criminal trial. After the break-in, Ms Clark said, Mr Combs told her she had to convince Mr Mescudi, \"it wasn't me\". \"If you don't convince him of that, I'll kill all you,\" he said, punctuating his threat with an expletive, Ms Clark said. Ms Clark said she and Ms Ventura then went to Mr Mescudi's home, telling jurors: \"We needed to talk to him. We needed to make sure he wasn't going to make a police report about Puff.\" After that, she said, she watched in shock as Mr Combs viciously assaulted Ms Ventura over her relationship with Mr Mescudi. Mr Combs kicked Mr Mescudi with \"100 per cent full force\" to the legs and back as she curled on the ground outside his home in a foetal position and wept silently, Ms Clark said. Ms Clark said her \"heart was breaking from seeing her get hit like that\" and that neither she nor Mr Combs's bodyguard intervened. The answer prompted an objection from Mr Combs's lawyers, and Judge Arun Subramanian told jurors to disregard it. Mr Combs's lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, questioned Ms Clark's recollection, leading her to reconsider certain details. She admitted some haziness about events that happened \"such a long time ago\". Cassie Ventura and Sean Combs at the 2018 Met Gala in New York City.(Getty: John Shearer) On Thursday, Mr Mescudi testified that he dated Ms Ventura briefly in December 2011, believing she had broken up with Mr Combs, but they agreed over the holidays to break up. Assistant US Attorney Mitzi Steiner questioned Ms Clark about her off-and-on employment with Mr Combs from 2004 to 2018, beginning with her first day, when, she said, Mr Combs and a bodyguard took her to Central Park after 9pm and said he had not been aware of her past work for other rappers. Ms Clark testified that Mr Combs told her that if that work became an issue, he would have to kill her. Ms Clark said she was only weeks into the job when Mr Combs tasked her with carrying diamond jewellery and it went missing. As a result, she said, she was repeatedly given lie detector tests over a five-day stretch by a man who seemed five times larger than her own size. \"He said: 'If you fail this test, they're going to throw you in the East River,'\" she recalled, adding that they eventually let her return to work. Even the alleged kidnapping did not scare Ms Clark away, Mr Agnifilo noted. Last year, after federal agents raided Mr Combs's homes, she suggested returning to his employment as his chief of staff. Mr Combs rejected the offer, Mr Agnifilo said. AP",

    "raw_text": "Muscian Billy Joel has cancelled his upcoming concerts across North America and England after being diagnosed with fluid build-up in his brain that has affected his hearing, vision and balance. Joel revealed on Instagram he had normal pressure hydrocephalus. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a a \"brain disorder that can affect brain-related abilities, including thinking and concentrating, memory, movement and more\", the Cleveland Clinic says. A statement from Joel's team said the musician's condition had been \"exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance\". \"Under his doctor's instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period,\" it said. In an accompanying statement, Joel said: \"I'm sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience, and thank you for understanding.\" In March, The Piano Man and Uptown Girl singer announced that he underwent surgery and had to undergo physical therapy. A statement at the time said doctors expected him to make a full recovery. It is unclear if his medical issues at the time were related to normal pressure hydrocephalus. The condition can cause problems with walking, bladder control and thinking, and the symptoms can worsen if the illness is left untreated. It is relatively rare and can be hard to diagnose. Billy Joel recently revealed he had undergone surgery.(Supplied: Facebook) It can be treated successfully with surgery to install a tube to drain excess fluid. Patients may need physical therapy in addition to surgery. Joel, 76, wrapped up his decade-long residency at Madison Square Garden in July 2024. However he had continued to tour. Tickets for his scheduled shows will be refunded. AP",
