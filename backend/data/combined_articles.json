AFL chief executive Andrew Dillon confirmed that inclusion and social policy manager Tanya Hosch will leave after nine years at the league.",
        "raw_text": "Laura Kane's AFL football operations role will be split, and Tanya Hosch's departure has been confirmed amid sweeping executive changes at league headquarters. Hosch's position of inclusion and social policy manager will also no longer exist as a separate role once the first Indigenous member of the AFL executive leaves on June 6. Instead, the existing corporate affairs portfolio will include First Nations engagement and inclusion, as well as media, communications and sustainability. There had been speculation this month Hosch was about to leave and she did not attend the Darwin launch of the league's showcase Sir Doug Nicholls round. Also this month, an AFL investigation first cleared Port Adelaide forward Willie Rioli for a threatening off-field message, then the league suspended him for a game once other on-field threats were made public. The AFL is embroiled in a firestorm following the serious concussion sustained by Collingwood's Lachie Schultz, and the miscommunication that has followed. That saga prompted the Power to renew concerns about ongoing racism in the game. Kane has become a lightning rod for criticism this season over issues such as Rioli, the standard of umpiring, and AFL miscommunication around what happened when Collingwood player Lachie Schultz was concussed in a game against Fremantle. A separate role will be created \u2014 head of football performance. Kane will continue to oversee the AFL and AFLW, plus the VFL and VFLW, and a newly formed medical and healthcare team that will oversee areas including mental health and concussion. The football performance manager's portfolio will include areas including match review, umpiring, game analysis, laws of the game and club engagement. ABC Sport is live blogging every round of theAFLandNRLseasons in 2025. ABC Sport is live blogging every round of theAFLandNRLseasons in 2025. Kane and the football performance boss will be on the AFL executive. \"The game is the reason we exist; it is as big and as good as it has ever been, and the AFL football department must continue to evolve,\" CEO Andrew Dillon said. \"It must be structured, resourced and led in a way that can ensure everyone \u2014 the clubs, players, coaches, umpires and officials \u2014 can continue to perform at the highest possible level. \"Laura will continue to play a major leadership role within the AFL, but the overall responsibility has grown so much that the traditional leadership role for an individual executive in footy is no longer the best model.\" Hosch will leave after nearly nine years in her role. Apart from being the first Indigenous person on the league executive, she was also the second woman. She has been at the forefront in areas such as Indigenous issues and gender diversity. Outside of Dillon, who took over from Gillon McLachlan as chief executive 18 months ago, Hosch has been the longest-serving person on the AFL executive. \"Tanya has been tireless in her work to ensure that inclusion has been a part of everything we have done \u2026 as an industry we are indebted to Tanya for making us better,\" Dillon said in a statement. In the same release, Hosch said she was \"extremely proud\" of what she had achieved at the league. \"At the AFL, we say we are 'a game for everyone' and I always saw my role as part of that story,\" she said The AFL is on the hunt for a new corporate affairs manager and a chief operating officer.

        "raw_text": "Connor Watson still isn't quite sure of how the pass happened, he's just glad that it did. The New South Wales utility put his stamp on another Origin as he latched onto a Zac Lomax pass close to the line, twisted his way through four Queensland defenders to pop a miracle ball up for Dylan Edwards to score the try that wrapped up Game I for the Blues on Wednesday night. It was a great show of skill and desire, albeit one Watson didn't get to see finished given he was trapped under a pile of Maroons defenders as Edwards crashed over but the noise was unmistakable. \"When I threw that ball I didn't know what was going to happen and then I heard everyone cheering \u2014 far out, no way that just came off,\" Watson said. \"It was a bit of a fluke \u2014 Lowy (Zac Lomax) got me the ball, the line was so close even though I knew I wouldn't get there myself. \"I just tried to throw it up and Dyl, being a great fullback, was in support got it across the line.\" It's the second Lang Park match in a row where Watson has come on fresh in the final stages of the match with the game in the balance and come up with a key play to steer the Blues home. In last year's decider, when he also came on with 15 to go and the match in the balance, he dribbled an offload to Jarome Luai deep in his own half that gave the New South Wales five-eighth the space to take on the Queensland defence,slice through and find Bradman Best for the breakout try of the game. Payne Haas was already counted as one of the best players in rugby league but his performance in Origin I was proof of the full breadth of the New South Wales prop's greatness. Watson's versatility opened the door for him to become part of the New South Wales side but through three games it's his impact late in matches that's come to the fore. In 30 minutes of game time combined across his last two matches, the Roosters hooker has made more of an impact than some players do in their Origin careers. It isn't easy to sit on the bench for over an hour and wait for your number to be called. It takes a lot of patience, both to ride it out and to not be too frantic when you come on in an effort to make the most of it. The latter was something Watson struggled with in the early stages of his career but has now mastered, especially for New South Wales. Like all good bench matchwinners, Watson understands that 15 minutes can be more than enough time to find a winning play. \"Early in my career, and I had this conversation with some of the younger guys at the Roosters this year, I'd chase it almost too much because when you get little time you want to make as much of an impact as possible,\" Watson said. \"But bring energy, putting yourself in different positions and those opportunities will come, you don't need to force them. \"When I was young I'd go on and try to go crazy, but you can burn out doing that. \"Coming on with 15 minutes to go is still plenty of time to make an impact, you just have to trust that opportunity will come. \"I was itching to get out there and it can take a while but it's worth the wait. \"I focus on my defence and in attack I just push, do that and things will be alright.\" After winning their first Lang Park decider in 30 years last series, making further history of their own was a focus for Laurie Daley's side in the lead up to Game I. They've now won back-to-back games at Lang Park for the first time in over a quarter-centuryand a win in Perth in three weeks' time would be their fourth consecutive victory and give the state it's longest winning streak since 1996-97. With Watson and his cohorts getting more and more acclimatised to the Origin furnace, it would take a brave punter to back against them doing so. \"Every Origin game I've played the physicality and the intensity of the contact stands out, that's what separates it from the NRL,\" Watson said. \"The ruck is a bit slower but the speed of the ball moving is higher, defences and attack moves faster. The more you play it, the more you understand what it's like. \"It's great to get a win up here, but there's still two games to go yet.\"",

The Swans message: \"Two cities, one team\" referred to the club's dual support base, from South Melbourne, who moved to Sydney in 1982.",
        "raw_text": "Sydney premiership coach Paul Roos has spoken of the moments that made a difference in the team's 2005 AFL grand final win, the feelings in the aftermath, and the rivalry with the great West Coast team of the era as the club prepares to celebrate 20 years on. In one of the closest grand finals in history, the Swans and the Eagles fought out a low-scoring epic at the MCG, with Sydney emerging with the win 8.10 (58) to 7.12 (54). The match is remembered for Sydney winning its first premiership in 72 years, dating back to the days of South Melbourne. It's also remembered for the match-winning pack mark taken by Leo Barry in the final seconds. Ahead of the club's 20-year celebration of the flag this weekend, Roos told ABC's AFL Daily podcast Barry's mark, great as it was, tended to overshadow other important elements that contributed to the win. \"Amon Buchanan\u2019s game \u2013 his spoil on the wing, tackle. Nik Fosdike\u2019s game was exceptional, Lewis Roberts-Thompson \u2026 the ball followed him for the first half, and I think it hit him on the back of the head when he was going up the race it was that attracted to him in the first half,\" Roos said. \"Leo [is remembered] and rightly so, with that mark but probably it takes away a little bit from the great efforts of the team. Barry Hall\u2019s goal, it was a big goal, Amon\u2019s goal [to put the Swans in front in the final quarter], there were so many moments, key moments that made a difference.\" Roos recalled the minutes after the game, celebrating with assistant coaches including John Longmire, who would succeed Roos as Swans coach and win the flag in 2012. \"We spent some lovely time in the box together. I was really fortunate that we played [the grand final] in 2005, when the coaches box was in the grandstand. So we walked down the grandstand, we didn\u2019t go down in the lift. \"We walked through the crowd, the Swans people walking on to the ground, all the people who\u2019d put money in, the administrators, the ex-players, Paul Kelly giving me the cup, family members \u2013 I still remember it vividly, it was just an amazing time.\" The theme of Sydney's 2005 grand final banner stuck in Paul Roos' mind when giving his speech after the Swans won the flag.(Getty Images: Mark Dadswell) His speech on the podium after the grand final became a much-quoted moment because of its conclusion as Roos said: \"For the people who've waited 72 years for South Melbourne \u2014 slash \u2014 Sydney Swans to win the premiership ... here it is!\". Roos told ABC the speech was a mix of preparation and a bit of off-the-cuff improvisation. \"You semi-rehearse your victory speech and [your one] if you lose. You want to be humble, gracious both if you win or lose,\" he said. \"But it was only when I saw the banner [before the game], and I think it was \"two cities, one team\" or something like that. I realised if we do win this it's sort of a culmination of a lot of hard work that went back to South Melbourne moving to Sydney [in 1982]. The Sydney Swans had plenty of support from Victorian-based fans as they made history at the MCG in 2005.(Getty Images: Mark Dadswell) \"When I got up on the podium that's when it jumped into my head, about the \"Here it is!\" for those who'd waited 72 years for Sydney/South Melbourne to win the premiership. So yes I'd rehearsed a little bit of it, but not that last part of it, and that came from seeing the banner before the game.\" Sydney coach Dean Cox famously played against Sydney in that grand final \u2014 and took a mark with seconds to go that launched the last desperate attack that was snuffed out by Leo Barry's famous mark. \"We [Longmire and I] chatted about his mark, because he marked it to kick it back in to Leo Barry, so he played a significant role. Coxy, if you had have lowered your eyes, mate, instead of bombing it to centre half-forward \u2026 but he was a phenomenal player. \"He's the only ruckman I think I've ever tagged, Dean Cox as a ruckman \u2026 he was just probably one of the most underrated players because he played with [Ben] Cousins and [Daniel] Kerr and [Chris] Judd and all those great players. \"He was an incredible player [himself] \u2014 it's quite ironic, isn't it, that he's now coaching the Swans! We'll do a lap of honour at half-time [against the Crows] \u2014 he's part of the 2006 [Eagles team] and he'll be celebrating next year with his West Coast mates! \"It was great times, great memories, great rivalry, great games, it really was \u2026 we had a great respect for them and them for us, I suspect. It'll be fun to reminisce on the weekend, and [I'm] looking forward to it\".",

The charges related to alleged incidents in suburban Perth, Beverley and Bindoon in late 2022 and early 2023. Police had alleged he was involved in burglaries on commercial properties in which hundreds of thousands of dollars was stolen, but the vast majority of those charges have now been dropped.

        "raw_text": "Interim Matildas coach Tom Sermanni has delivered a scathing critique of the A-League Women competition's professionalism, stating that Australian football remains \"grossly underinvested\" in the women's game. That the league is not yet fully professional is particularly \"irritating\" for Sermanni, given the blockbuster success of the 2023 Women's World Cup. Arsenal's Matildas trio \u2014 Caitlin Foord, Steph Catley and Kyra Cooney-Cross \u2014 are celebrating after the English giants toppled Barcelona 1-0 to claim the UEFA Women's Champions League title. Every player in the Matildas squad has played in the ALW at some point, including six players currently in the domestic league. But on Thursday, women's football stalwart Sermanni, typically a happy-go-lucky character, unleashed both barrels. \"We really need to have, at A-League level, a real rethink,\" he said. \"The league has been going for 17 years. When we started the league, and the coaches came from our institute programs, we had full-time coaches and more full-time staff than we have now, 17 years in. \"The A-League separated five years ago and what we have done since then is we've got home and away, which is an improvement, but we are still grossly under-invested in the women's game here. \"I don't know if there's a thought process going forward about where they want to take the league or what they want to do. But there's a huge amount of work that actually needs to be done. We put the spotlight on women making a big impact on and off the field in the sporting world \u2014 from the grassroots through to the elite level. \"It's even more irritating when you think how we had the most successful World Cup ever two years ago, and A-League Women are in the situation that they're in now, it's just not good enough.\" The ALW, formerly W-League, started in 2008. \"At that time, our league was the forefront of women's leagues, to be perfectly honest,\" Sermanni said. \"It's still very important, and coaches, staffs and players are doing exceptionally well. But the league itself is in need of significant improvement in its professionalism. \"There are three clubs that are suitably staffed \u2014 that's Melbourne City, Melbourne Victory and Wellington Phoenix. And the rest of the clubs are completely inadequately staffed. \"Players get 35-week contracts now. \"A league has just started in Canada \u2014 football-wise, we're well in advance of Canada \u2014 where the base salary is twice what our basic salary is, where there's full-time staff, full-time players. ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines. \"And we are still trying to produce players when we have a space of three months where the club has got no contact, no control, no reference point for the players, to actually keep them and know what's happening.\" Professional Footballers Australia has warned of the potential for a \"player drain\" from the ALW and its effect on developing Matildas if the league isn't fully professionalised. CEO Beau Busch reiterated that it needed to happen by the 2026-27 season to capitalise on next year's Asian Cup. \"Setting that as our target and achieving it will prevent us falling further behind as global standards continue to rise at pace,\" he said. The Australian Professional Leagues have been contacted for comment. In Canada's Northern Super League, where new call-up Kahli Johnson plays, the minimum wage is $56,000, more than double the ALW's $26,000, with a salary cap of $1.8 million compared to $600,000. Sermanni will coach the Matildas for the 150th time across three stints in Friday night's clash with Argentina at Marvel Stadium, with Central Coast's Emily Husband and Western United's Kat Smith among his assistants. Arsenal trio Steph Catley, Caitlin Foord and Kyra Cooney-Cross are unlikely to start after only arriving in camp on Wednesday night following their Women's Champions League triumph. AAP",

        "raw_text": "Dumb, scrappy, flat, ill-disciplined \u2026 there aren't a lot of positive words to describe Queensland's performance in the 2025 State of Origin opener. We've seen powerful Blues sides run over the top of physically outmatched Maroons a handful of times in recent years, but rarely have they been so utterly outplayed bya NSW side that didn't even need to play its best to win. After giving away three entirely avoidable penalties in the opening nine minutes, and six in the first half, it was only by dint of some Blues miscues that the half-time deficit was two converted tries. If Nathan Cleary and Zac Lomax had slotted everything they kicked, hardly an unlikely prospect with those two, the 27-6 full-time score would have been the Blues' biggest win since 2022, and a more accurate reflection of what we witnessed on Wednesday night. As ever, you couldn't question the Maroons' grit. Despite apparently being outmatched in the forwards, Queensland's starting middles were up for the contest. It was when the Maroons got the ball in hand that it all fell apart, and Billy Slater's side simply will never win if the attack is not clicking like the Swiss timepiece it is supposed to be. The core of this team has seen it all. NSW wins the State of Origin series opener 18-6 with a spectacular performance on the Maroons' home turf at Lang Park. Despite fielding three debutants, eight of the 17 Maroons who took the field in Game I debuted five or more years ago. Daly Cherry-Evans and Cameron Munster have been set and forget in the halves for just as long. Rapid outside backs, even if one of them was first-gamer Rob Toia, were also supposed to be a rare point in favour of Queensland in the lead-up. Combine that with comfortably the better dummy-half on paper, Harry Grant, and the team should be able to cut through defences like your mum's fancy fabric scissors gliding through wrapping paper. Instead, the attack couldn't have been much worse, and Grant was either a microcosm or a catalyst for that. Harry Grant had a rough start to Origin I.(Getty Images: Chris Hyde) In the seventh minute, he looked off club teammate Munster at first receiver, turned short side and kicked high, ostensibly for Xavier Coates, but ending up in the easiest in-goal catch for Brian To'o. He also came up with crucial handling errors and gave away the most baffling of the penalties, blatantly kicking at the ball as the Blues were trying to play it. For the consensus best hooker in the game, it was a performance too bad to simply be chalked up to rust from a hamstring lay-off, but he's just the guy who touches the ball more than anyone else. It felt like on this night, anyone in a maroon jumper with that many receipts would have had a similar night. The Blues, sporting their sixth spine combination in seven games, had moments of clunk but when they strung it together it was glorious. The Maroons could barely, as Slater likes to say, \"get their footy on\". Their completion rate of 78 per cent was underwhelming if not abysmal, but it was what they did (or didn't do) in those 32 completed sets that left Slater with a thousand-mile stare after the game. \"I feel pretty flat about our performance \u2026 the flatness comes from how we hurt ourselves,\" he told reporters after the game. \"Close enough on the scoreboard, but not close enough in terms of the way we were playing.\" The Blues manhandled Queensland's electric outside backs.(Getty Images: Chris Hyde) So poor was the performance that it raised legitimate questions if the likes of captain Cherry-Evans, struggling at club level and embroiled in another contract saga, had gone one year too many. Tom Dearden is waiting in the wings, but he has a 1-27 win-loss record with a seven on his back since May 2019. And, with the \"sixiest\" of sixes in Munster, throwing Dearden into halfback is not the cure-all some hope it could be. The alternative is ditching the mercurial Munster and that feels too risky considering he's one of only a few players who have truly won Origins off their own bat. The 36-year-old Cherry-Evans, now officially the oldest player to take the field in Origin, said he understood why people were asking but added he would \"love the opportunity\" to try to rectify things \u2014 a right he's earned and deserves. Only 10 games into his NRL career, Robert Toia looked ready for Origin.(Getty Images: Bradley Kanaris) Slater stayed silent in that moment, although he was adamant before and after the fact that the team's issues were with execution, not personnel. Despite injuries to Tom Gilbert, Ben Hunt, Reece Walsh and potential debutant Jack Howarth, it's hard to argue with Slater's assessment when you look at the Origin experience in his line-up. New blood isn't the answer, but figuring out why the current blood is clotting when it should be flowing may be a trickier conundrum to solve. \"In terms of how close we were to playing our best footy, we were nowhere near it,\" Slater said. There were bright spots like Tino Fa'asuamaleaui, whose pre-match tears turned into an opening frenzy that cost a penalty but truly took it to NSW. Tino Fa'asuamaleaui was emotional before the match and carried it into the opening minutes.(Getty Images: Bradley Kanaris) Or rookie Toia, who looked completely comfortable on the main stage after just 10 games of NRL. Moeaki Fotuaika aimed up in the middle and Jeremiah Nanai deserved a try assist for the shot he put on Latrell Mitchell, but none of that is going to help the Maroons nail their block shapes or finesse their last-tackle plays. Slater and his experienced spine need sit down and look at how it went so wrong for them almost every time they tried to \"get their footy on\". \"I know there's so much more in this footy team,\" Slater said of Game I. You'd hope so, otherwise there will be some very tough conversations for players and coach in the weeks ahead.",

        "raw_text": "A gender-diverse netballer has labelled an opposition club \"hypocrites\" after they were removed from a second senior women's netball league. Manawa Aranui's removal came after club complaints and \"safety concerns\". They hit out on social media after they and another gender-diverse player were deemed ineligible to play in the Riddells District Football Netball League (RDFNL) for the rest of the season due to their \"superior stamina and physique\". In a statement, the league said opposition clubs had threatened to boycott matches involving Aranui. According to Aranui's social media post, complaints made against them to the league came from the same club that had tried to recruit them. \"The same club now publicly speaking out against me, bashing me, and attacking the trans/non-binary community in the media, is the very club whose head coach approached me to join you,\" they wrote. Aranui denied claims they were \"dangerous\" and had \"run full-speed into players and (knocked) them over\", stating they had never been \"warned, penalised, or reprimanded\". The opposing club has been approached for comment. Teams in the RDFNL threatened to boycott matches in which the players competed because they felt \"physically and mentally threatened on court\". An RDFNL spokesperson said the league would continue to adopt Netball Victoria's gender and anti-discrimination policies, but said it had no choice but to look at what neighbouring leagues were doing. \"We are also working very closely with some other leagues on a sub-section under the Netball Victoria Policy that gives our league the opportunity to be flexible,\" the spokesperson said. The spokesperson said Netball Victoria had this month appointed an \"external investigator\" to look at the participation of the players. A western Victorian netball player has hit out at criticism.(AAP: Dave Hunt) \"The RDFNL are yet to receive further information on the external investigator and have had no communication from said person,\" the spokesperson said. Netball Victoria's gender diversity policy states that players are allowed to play \"in accordance with their gender identity, irrespective of their legal sex classification\". However, the governing body's guidance to clubs also confirms that players can be excluded from competitions when their \"strength, stamina or physique of players is relevant\". It was the second time Aranui had been deemed ineligible to play in a competition this year. The ABC understands Aranui was also excluded from the Ballarat Football Netball League (BFNL) in April to \"protect the safety of all players\". A statement from the league said it had deemed the player ineligible, and that they had previously played \"with an all-male netball team and now identifies as gender diverse\". The league said it sought legal advice that it could lawfully exclude the player from a sporting competition where \"strength, stamina or physique of competitors is relevant\". \"We have tremendous empathy for the player involved and absolutely respect and support their personal choices and respect their right to privacy,\" the BFNL spokesperson said. In 2024,World Netball banned transgender players from international competition with immediate effect under a new participation and inclusion policy. Two gender diverse players have been removed from Victorian netball leagues.(AAP: Scott Barbour) In a statement, Netball Victoria said it continued to support netballers of all backgrounds, including gender-diverse players. \"When concerns about safety in any form are raised, Netball Victoria will and does undertake a review in the interests of the welfare of participants.\" Sporting administrator Peta Guy said each case needed to be judged on its specifics, especially in contact-heavy sports. \"If you've got something where people have high impact, you know AFL, rugby or something like that, then you know size and strength really does matter. Peta Guy has played women's cricket, badminton and basketball.(Supplied: Peta Guy) \"The overriding principle is that no association wants to drive potential players away and at the same time, they've got to be completely aware of how decisions that they make impact their members, the players.\" Ms Guy said when rules were set, there would be exceptions. \"I think you've got to look at the fundamental principles, the health and wellbeing of the players and fairness,\" she said. Ms Guy said there had been rules implemented on gender policy in England. \"It's now having adverse consequences, particularly in an era where you have non-binary people,\" she said. \"If you have a rule that then excludes them \u2026 then you're not doing your sport the best favour.\"",

        "raw_text": "On Wednesday night, as he claimed his first State of Origin man of the match award, Payne Haas had one of those games that makes you think he could carry the whole world on his shoulders. A performance like this from Haas in Origin has been a long time coming. He has been marked for greatness since he was still a boy because his strengths have been so blindingly obvious. In a game made for big, strong men, Haas is the biggest and the strongest and can go the longest. That has been true since he was first propelled into a New South Wales jersey as a 19-year old with just 10 NRL games to his name. That was a long time ago now. Of the Blues who played on Wednesday night, only Latrell Mitchell, Nathan Cleary and Angus Crichton made their Origin debuts before Haas. Ever since, he's been an automatic selection when fit and even if he's not fit \u2014 like he was in the lead-up to this game as he battled a quad injury \u2014 he's still important to have around. NSW wins the State of Origin series opener 18-6 with a spectacular performance on the Maroons' home turf at Lang Park. Haas has played strong Origin matches before, in victory and defeat. His efforts for the Broncos are proof enough he is the apex predator in the front-row jungle, but this game was a showcase of his all-round quality. He is a superb athlete \u2014 enough so that NFL teams made a few calls about the big lad with the quick feet when Haas was still at school \u2014 but he is also a superb footballer in ways far subtler than the bash and crash of the middle third of the field. Let us start with the numbers because, as ever, they are mighty. Haas finished with 18 runs for 154 metres, five tackle busts, three offloads and 30 tackles without a miss. But they do not tell the full story of how Haas bent the game to his will. In a world consumed by fantasy sports, we can sometimes reduce a player to the level of their stats, even a player like Haas who routinely puts up high counts in every category you could ask for from a prop. There was the good sense and deft hands he showed in linking with Nathan Cleary in the lead up to the first try. There was the second effort that forced an error from Harry Grant that secured possession for the Blues, and on the ensuing set a probing run that caught a defender offside before Brian To'o's try. There were kick chases, where he led the way as the Blues piled numbers into Queensland kick returns to turn the screws on the Maroons' smaller back five. All told, his first stint was 30 minutes of righteous fury and finely honed power. It put the Blues on top and despite a shaky moment or two, with a foundation like that, Queensland could not move them. Haas showed his all-round quality in an outstanding display.(Getty Images: Bradley Kanaris) It would have been astonishing in any case and given he had, by Laurie Daley's estimation, about a quarter of a training session in the lead-up, it was astounding. His second stint was harder. The game was in the balance after Brian To'o's sin-bin and some poor goalkicking had left the door just ajar enough for Queensland to barge their way through if they were capable. But Haas never seems to slow, never seems to tire, never seems to feel the burn even as the heat rises. If what drives him could be converted into pure energy, oil prices would plummet. In the second half there were fewer rampaging runs, but he still dragged defenders with him. Early in the game, he was roaming a pass or two wide, shaking the stadium with his charges. Later on, it was all up the guts against the other big boys. Haas finished with more post-contact metres than some Queensland forwards had metres, further proof that no matter the kind of fight, he bows to nobody. A controversial sin bin, some spectacular individual efforts, and the game's best kickers have a nightmare at Lang Park. Here are the five quick hits from State of Origin I. There were fewer busted tackles, but more off-ball movement \u2014 Haas runs as fast to get into position to be an extra decoy as some players do when they run the ball. It is an underrated facet of his game and proof he does not chase stats or gorge himself on easy metres. He attacks the unglamorous things of winning as much as he does the bone and blood battles. Some of the best yardage forwards in the league can be found wanting without the ball but Haas's defence remained impeccable even as the game got sharper and harder, both one-on-one and in gang tackles to slow the Queensland ruck. All told, Haas is the total package when it comes to prop forward play, as though he was raised in a laboratory by a mad scientist who loved genetic engineering as much as they loved late footwork before the defensive line and high-speed forward collisions. As strong as Haas was, it was not a one-man show. Were it not for Haas, Zac Lomax would have been a fine choice for man of the match in his own right given he excelled in yardage, scored a double, helped set up the match-sealing try and spent time on both wings to cover for To'o's sin bin. His last 12 months on the flank, after initially being against the move, is proof home is where you find it. Apart from the time in the bin, To'o was also strong, Stephen Crichton had a blinder defensively and Angus Crichton continued the kind of form that won him a Wally Lewis Medal last year. But this was Haas's night, his moment to be borne home shoulder high if only someone had his strength and those don't come along often enough. It's not that Haas isn't given his dues \u2014 he is, and he earns them as one of the only things Brisbane can rely on as their season skids out of control. It's that Haas has reached that special level of achievement, where what is expected is beyond what any other player can typically produce. A normal Payne Haas game can be the game of another man's life, so for a match of his to stand-out he must become truly superhuman. Only the best reach that level, where we grow accustomed to their wonder and Haas is a wonder.",

        "raw_text": "Getting clothes and linen dry in constant wet weather can be frustrating. Maybe you don't have the luxury of a tumble dryer, or you're reluctant to use it to save on your next power bill. Add a sudden drop in temperature and the process of drying our washing can become even tricker. Some experts, like Lish Fejer, a science communicator and ABC reporter in Ngambri/Canberra, discourage the use of tumble dryers because of the amount of energy they consume and the impact they can have on your clothes. \"[Tumble] drying is bad for your clothes; it wears them down,\" Lish says. Lish runsThe Fix It Chickswith co-creator Jenny Edwards, teaching people cheap ways to wash and dry laundry. Here are some of the alternative methods you can use for drying clothes and linen in wet or cold weather. If the clothes can withstand it (avoid wool, linens and silks, for example), put them on ahigh-spin cycle in the washing machine, and repeat. \"You can give drying a head start by spinning to get rid of as much water as possible,\" Lish says. Humidity can be an issue when drying clothes inside as excess moisture can cause mould and mildew.(Adobe Stock) When you take your clothes out of the washing machine, she suggestsrolling them up in a clean, dry towelto remove excess moisture. Lish says when using a rack for air drying, make sure theclothes are spaced out wellso air can circulate around each item. Using pegs means you won't have to fold the items over. \"Look atany glass or window that is being hit by the sun\u2014 put your drying rack there, that will activate the drying process,\" Lish says. If heading out for the day, hang sheets and towels over chairs and tables. \"I love a coat hanger;I hang shirts on them and put them over door framesand architraves.\" Ventilation is important to minimise condensation and avoid mould. \"Humidity in the house is a big one [if drying clothes indoors],\" says Lish. \"How do you get rid of that moisture in your house without it causing mould and mildew and the health effects that come with that?\" She recommendsopening a windowto manage this (weather dependent). You can also increase air flow indoors byusing a pedestal or ceiling fanwhich Lish says uses little energy and helps with evaporation. Theextraction fan in your bathroomwill be effective when drying in there. Somesplit-system air conditioners have a dehumidifying modethat doesn't cool or heat (and therefore costs less to run). Drying happens best outside, so if you have the space, take advantage. If its overcast or rainy, using a balcony or undercover area is ideal \u2014 even if shady and cold. Awindy dayis a bonus, as items will dry faster. If you're strapped for time (or motivation), throw the wet load of washing onto an outdoor table on a towel in the sun, on a picnic blanket, on the trampoline, or on the heated floor. For small items, Lish lays themon a towel in the back of her carand parks it in the sun while at work. \"You do have to occasionally go turn them over, and I leave the windows open a little.\" If you have ahot water systemin the cupboard, you could also fold clothes that are nearly dry and place them on top. \"Be careful not to cover the pressure valve,\" warns Lish. Lish says tothrow in a clean, dry towel with your wet items. \"That will significantly reduce the amount of time it needs to be on for as it absorbs some of the moisture.\" Susan Toft, the CEO and founder of a nationwide domestic laundry business, says the biggest mistake people make is simply \"putting items in that are not meant for the dryer, because you can damage them\". \"Wool, in particular, will shrink. And that's probably the thing we see the most,\" she says. But, she says, you should alsotake great care with bras, other delicate items(such as anything with silk), and clothing with prints on it. \"The best tip is to always follow the care label,\" she says. Consumer advocacy group CHOICE also advises caution when drying anything with lycra in it \u2014 so throwing in your activewear might not be the best bet. But if you do end up shrinking something, it's not the end of the world. For jumpers, you canwet them and pat them out with towels to try and stretch them back out, and then leave them to dry in a shady spot.",

        "raw_text": "Is car parking a source of contention on your street? Maybe it's hard to find a spot, there's a neighbour who parks too close to your driveway, or caravans are being parked for long periods. If you want to tackle your parking problems, here are some things to consider. Parking issues are common across Australia, including in suburbanAdelaideandgrowing regional towns. Louise Crawford is the Mayor of Port Phillip Council in Naarm/Melbourne, where parking can be tricky to come by \u2014 depending on the street. \"We're incredibly limited in the amount of parking spaces that we have,\" she says. Estelle Grech says it's important that people aren't using \"public space like their personal garage\".(Supplied: Committee for Sydney) Katy Woods, a senior lawyer with Legal Aid NSW on Gadigal land in Sydney, says the organisation \"regularly get calls about drivers who park outside another person's home or over someone's driveway\". Estelle Grech is the policy manager at the Committee for Sydney, an urban policy think tank. In some instances, she says parking shortages are \"perceived\" because it's assumed changes or development in the area always equates to less parking. She says more housing needs to be planned near public transport so car space availability is less of an issue and people can choose not to have a car. Ms Woods recommends people contact their council if they're \"consistently unable to park outside their home\". She says most New South Wales councils have online forms to raise parking grievances. If you live in an apartment, Ms Woods suggests raising the issue with your strata manager instead. Ms Grech says expecting a park outside your home is not realistic in every area. \"People need to remember that they don't own the street outside their house as well,\" she says. However, she adds \"it makes sense to have a park ideally reserved directly outside your house\" if you have mobility issues. Different Australian states and cities have a process to apply for anaccessibility parking permit,mobility parking permitoran equivalent. The eligibility requirements and processes differ, but mobility limitation caused by a medical condition, injury or disability are common prerequisites. Additionally, Cr Crawford saysPort Philip Councilhas a process for accessibility parking permit holders to request an accessible on-street parking space outside their home. The process is similar in other areas, and you can check with your local council. Cr Crawford says a \"polite conversation\" with your neighbour is warranted if their parking is obstructing driveways. Katy Woods says its best to seek legal advice before taking any legal action.(Supplied: Legal Aid NSW) While leaving an anonymous note on their windscreen might be tempting, Ms Woods says it's \"unlikely to resolve the issue\". \"Be respectful, and keep in mind that there may be personal circumstances, such as mobility issues or illness, that your neighbours are dealing with.\" If you can't resolve the issue, a mediation service could be the next step. Mediation facilitators can be found online. Mis Woods says legal action should be a last resort and if you are ever \"concerned for your safety, contact the police and seek advice about obtaining an [apprehended violence order]\". Cr Crawford says that if driveway access is blocked, council can also tow the offending vehicles, which happens about four to five times a week in her area. Ms Woods also says, if a car is blocking the driveway of causing a hazard you can report it to police. Louise Crawford says increasing the number of permits in an area doesn't create more space for car parks.(Supplied: Port Phillip Council) The rules covering street parking differ from council to council and often vary drastically from street to street. In Port Phillip Council, Cr Crawford says the permit system has been tightened. She says at one stage there was a family that had eight residential parking permits. She says parking permits are now usually restricted to one per household for new residents. Permits also help set realistic expectations about parking availability in the area, Cr Crawford says. Cr Crawford says caravans and trailers being parked for long periods is \"becoming a greater issue\", and council is considering introducing new laws to address it. The sight of campervans, caravans, buses and trailers blocking views and parking spots is source of frustration for Gold Coast locals. \"In some areas where we don't have any parking restrictions ... people are turning them into private caravan and trailer storage areas.\" In NSW, Ms Woods says that if a vehicle is \"more than 7.5 metres long or weighs more than 4.5 tonnes, it is classified as a heavy and long vehicle\", which means there are additional rules for parking. She also recommends checking the relevant council website for information about where you can or can't park a caravan or boat trailer.",

        "raw_text": "Earlier this year, I went to my mob's Country for the first time. I had never known my connection to Country, as I grew up physically isolated in Lutruwita/Tasmania, with feelings of shame about being Aboriginal. I knew that I had family living on Country in Far North Queensland, but both the people and the place felt so far away. As I got older, I felt a blossoming urge to learn more about my culture. I reached out to family, joined First Nations organisations, and also did an old-fashioned online search. I learnt that the official name for my mob was Dulgubarra-Yidinji, which translates to \"belongs to the rainforest Yidinji\" in our language, which I am also now beginning to learn. Finally, at age 27, I decided to travel to Dulgubarra-Yidinji Country. I knew that when I visited for the first time, I wanted to understand how to do so respectfully. So, to prepare for my own journey to Country for the first time, I asked some experts for their advice on how to approach and prepare for the experience. Visiting Country for the first time can be a profound way to deepen your connection to your heritage, according to Bardi Jawi First Nations culture consultant and writer, Bebe Oliver. \"Honestly, there's no stronger way to do that than to be surrounded by the land that raised your family and your ancestors,\" he says. Bebe Oliver, says returning to Country was like coming home to a place he never left.(Supplied: Bebe Oliver) Mr Oliver grew up on Bardi Jawi Country in Western Australia's Kimberley region, swimming, collecting shells, and learning about the animals and the seasons, and felt a deep connection to his family. When he later returned after living away for 20 years, he says it was like coming home to a place he never left. He says reasons for visiting Country can vary and the experience will look different for every person and every language group; Some people seek a deeper connection to their family, while others may want to have a strong spiritual experience. Bebe Oliver says the experience of visiting Country will look different for every person and every language group.(Supplied: Bebe Oliver) And, he adds, often, people find that they are connected to Country in ways they didn't expect. \"That happens a lot for Blak people because so much of our history has been disrupted through dispossession and forced removals.\" Samantha Faulkner is the editor and curator of the book Growing Up Torres Strait Islander in Australia, and a Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal woman, from Badu and Moa Islands in the Torres Strait and the Yadhaigana and Wuthathi peoples of Cape York Peninsula, Queensland. She says as a starting place it's important to \"seek permission from the appropriate people or body [and] watch others and take your cues from them\". Ms Faulkner advises that the Torres Strait Regional Authority have put together a useful 32-page book that you can find on their website: www.tsra.gov.au. It's worth checking online for relevant resources for the Country you are hoping to visit. Mr Oliver believes that one of the most important aspects of visiting Country is connecting with local people and communities. \"Respect is a core value in Blak cultures, and it's something we need to bring with us every step of the way. That means speaking to the local mob first and foremost,\" says Mr Oliver. Ms Faulkner recommends also planning time for space and reflection in your visit, to give you an opportunity to sit with your feelings about connection to family, Country and ancestors. \"It can be overwhelming at times, so take time out for yourself at the end of the day or find a quiet space to decompress,\" Ms Faulkner advises. Visiting Country can have a significant effect on emotional and mental wellbeing. And that can look different for everyone, according to Dr Carmen Cubillo, a proud saltwater woman and clinical psychologist from Larrakia and Wadjigan Country in the Northern Territory. Dr Cubillo had her own cultural journey coming to her Country at the beginning of her clinical psychology career. She says that visiting country isn't like in the movies, and that it's normal to feel grief about being on colonised land. However, Dr Cubillo also says that many have a positive experience coming to Country for the first time. Dr Carmen Cubillo and her sister Peta Marie Bellew on Country.(Supplied: Carmen Cubillo) \"You may have feelings of peace or yearning, to know more and be there more, to soak up the goodness of Country. \"There is a special energy that only you and Country can feel as a relationship.\" She says that there is no one correct or appropriate way to feel when you visit country, but advises that if you feel you need support it is important to reach out to a medical or mental health professional to help process the feelings. Have you had an experience of visiting Country for the first time? We'd love to hear from you.Emaillifestyle@abc.net.au When I visited Dulgubarra-Yidinji Country, it was just as the experts had said. I felt a smorgasbord of emotions. I was nervous to speak with new family I had never met, overwhelmed by the cultural knowledge I learned, and in awe as I drove through the clouds on the side of a mountain. This is me at Lake Barrine near Yungaburra. During my trip my Elders said that while my feet were on this land I was a traditional owner myself. That was a new and powerful concept for me.(Chloe Padmore) In school assemblies, meeting and events I had always acknowledged the Traditional Owners of the Country I lived on. During my trip my Elders said that while my feet were on this land I was a traditional owner myself. This was a very powerful concept and it evoked a lot of emotions that I processed both during and after the trip. And while some of those feelings were hard, overall the experience was transformative. In my hotel, learning some of my language while on Country. NOTE: No-one but Dulgubarra-Yidinji Clan members are allowed to cite the pictured language books until authorised to do so.(Chloe Padmore) My chest was filled with the strange sensation of coming home to a place I was visiting for the first time. This sort of feeling, of belonging to something I never thought I could connect to, was truly life changing. Sitting with Elders, listening to my mob's stories, made me feel so lucky. I was honoured to listen as they spoke our sacred truths. Under all my personal feelings for my new-found connection to Country, I didn't want to leave, because I know I have so much to learn. I now have a sense that this place is, in many ways, my true home \u2014 a place I need to return to. Skye Cusack is a Dulgubarra-Yidinji writer currently living in Rubibi/Broome.",

Professor Zhong says, \"it really depends on the specific terms and conditions, but usually you get points for every dollar that you spend.\" Reward points can then be spent on perks and benefits which differ between credit cards and institutions, but can include gift cards, retail purchases and discounted travel offers. These type of credit cards may \"also offer exclusive perks\", such as \"access to airport lounges, travel insurance and concierge services\". The government'sMoneySmartsite says credit card reward programs \"sound good\" because \"you could earn points you can use to buy movie tickets or flights\" just by spending on the card. Toni Eager is a senior marketing lecturer at the Australian National University in Canberra, on the land of the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people. She says rewards schemes, including points are \"a way of keeping customers\". \"People might like certain reward schemes more than others, or it's something that keeps people using the card that they already have rather than going out and looking for cheaper interest rates.\" Dr Eager says consumers need to be financially literate to get good value from reward points schemes, which reward spending. \"Whether it encourages people to overspend or changes their spending habits comes down to financial literacy.\" Toni Eager says rewards schemes can also be difficult to understand.(Supplied: Australian National University) Consumer groupChoicesays credit card reward schemes are not for everyone. \"Unless you're a big spender, credit cards with rewards schemes are mostly a gimmick, and they nearly always charge hefty annual fees and high interest rates.\" These costs can \"easily nullify the rewards\". A survey finds more than half of people aged 18 to 29 with a credit card sign up solely to earn travel rewards points, but 60 per cent are struggling to clear their debts each month. Professor Zhong also says to be mindful that \"you pay for what you get.\" Credit cards with extra perks will also have higher fees and interest rates. \"It makes them more costly if you don't pay your balances in full or on time.\" She also warns that banks and lenders can change their loyalty programs including the value of points, and points can also expire. \"Read the terms and conditions carefully, especially when it comes to the changing value of your points.\" Prfoessor Zhong says, \"point hackers\" are people who regularly open and cancel credit cards. The practice is known as \"credit card churning\". \"You open multiple credit cards to take advantage of the bonuses, and then you close them and repeat the process again with new cards.\" She says many lenders waive the first annual fee for these types of credit cards, which can also come with bonus offers (additional points or cashback for example) and a zero per cent balance transfer fee for a set period. Using a credit card linked to your offset account can save on your mortgage but you need to be aware of the pitfalls to decide whether it will work for you. The card can then be cancelled before the annual fee for the second year is charged. Initial bonuses usually come with conditions, such as \"spending a certain amount in the first three months\". Professor Zhong says credit card churning can lower your credit score, and \"frequent credit card application and cancellation might be a bit of a red flag\" if you're applying for a mortgage. Doing this with different credit cards simultaneously increases the risk you miss a repayment, or you fail to make full use of the rewards, she says. MoneySmartrecommends looking for a low interest rate and features you'll use in a credit card. If you're considering a credit card with a reward scheme, \"check if the benefits you get are worth the higher cost\". Professor Zhong says to \"choose a card that aligns with your spending habits so that you can maximise the points [and] maintain a healthy financial lifestyle\".",

        "raw_text": "Nadine Ensor always suspected she would delay sending her daughter, born in June, to school. \"She was very advanced with language and the standard things they check off, like being able to count and recite the alphabet, so I had no doubts academically she could have gone [when first eligible],\" says 36-year-old Nadine, based in Brisbane/Meanjin. \"For me, [the motivation to delay] was definitely more the emotional side of things.\" Regulations around the age children start school vary across Australia, and between public, Catholic and independent schools. Typically, however, children born in the first part of the year can be sent to school in either the year they turn five or the year they turn six. If Nadine's daughter started school when she was first eligible, she would have been four and a half, and one of the youngest in her class. \"I also worried about the social aspects, and also fatigue,\" Nadine says. \"If she was starting school when [she was] four and a half, she would just be too burnt-out.\" For parents of children with disability, worries about how their child will transition into school can be heightened. But there are ways to help manage it. New research from Macquarie University found that of Australian parents who could choose when to send their children to school, 66 per centplanned for them to start later. The study surveyed 226 parents. Co-author Penny Van Bergen, an associate professor of psychology in education at the university, said one of the most interesting findings was that academic concerns didn't typically play a role in parents' decision-making. \"A lot of international research says academic competitiveness is why you might hold a child back, but there wasn't a sense [parents in Australia] were making those choices for competitive reasons,\" Dr Van Bergen says. Like Nadine, many parents are concerned about their children's social, emotional and behavioural readiness for school, Dr Van Bergen says. \"Whether a child would make friends, be able to sit still \u2014 parents were seeing that as a sign they are probably not ready and won't enjoy themselves if they are still developing those skills.\" Rebecca English, a senior education lecturer at the Queensland University of Technology, says parents may also be concerned about their child needing a nap or rest time, and other factors such as whether the child has toileting accidents. Another motivation for Nadine delaying her daughter's schooling was the family dynamic. \"I had a newborn that year, so I didn't want the whole commitment of school alongside a newborn as well,\" she says. She also wanted to spend more time with her daughter, a desire shared by some parents surveyed in the Macquarie University study. Wanting to spend more time together is one motivation for parents delaying their child's schooling.(Pexels) Dr Van Bergen says there is a philosophy of \"they are really little, let them enjoy life, there's plenty of time for school\". \"They recognised they were privileged to make that choice, but talked about wanting that extra 'gift of time'.\" Parents were also considering milestones ahead, such as when their children would reach the ages they could drive and drink. \"We don't want them to be the last to get their drivers licence,\" Dr Van Bergen gives as an example. Because early childhood education and child care are more expensive than public schooling, some parents felt they had to send their child \"on time\", Dr Van Bergen says. Work demands also played a role. From hair length to skirt length, school uniform policies, or dress codes, dictate many aspects of a student's appearance. But how enforceable are they? Boys are more likely to be \"held back\", Dr Van Bergen explains, due to \"beliefs about boys not being social and emotionally ready\". Parents she surveyed were almost four times as likely to report they intended to start boys later than girls. \"There is a narrative that boys are less mature, or less developed, than girls that floats around, and that drives parents' decision-making,\" Dr Van Bergen says. She says while at a group level there are school-readiness trends that favour girls, on an individual level there is a \"huge overlap\" between genders, so readiness really needs to be considered case by case. Parents reported concerns about physical size, usually more with boys than girls. This is particularly in the context of bullying and \"sporting prowess\", Dr Van Bergen says. Some parents are concerned their children will be smaller than their classmates.(Adobe Stock) Five per cent of the parents surveyed by Macquarie University said they were still unsure about when to send their child to school. Dr English says it can be hard for parents to know what to expect from school because things will have changed a lot since their years of education. \"Talk to the school. Talk to your peers. If you have a psychologist or occupational therapist or speech therapist, talk to them as well,\" she says. \"If you are on the NDIS, talk to your providers.\" She says it can also be helpful to ask relatives and friends with older children about their experience, as well as instructors of the child's extra-curricular activities, such as swimming. Dr Van Bergen says parents should follow their instincts. \"School teachers do an amazing job to support children and bring them into a different educational context, but it's still a big transition,\" she says. She recommends parents avoid being \"fatalistic\" about their decision. \"If there are any education gaps between younger and older children to start with, [research shows] it closes over time.\" Nadine says she \"100 per cent\" made the right decision by delaying her daughter's schooling. \"There is so much pressure on prep and so many commitments \u2026 it's full on.\" This is general information only.

        "raw_text": "I grew up knowing how to keep small. Not in the way that little girls are often taught \u2014 polite, nice, quiet \u2014 but in a way that was about survival. I was raised with a belief that if I was too loud or too disruptive, if I talked about my home life too much, that this would make me more visible and more susceptible to questioning and judgement from people with power to take me away. I knew this not as something that happened in the past, but as living memory. I remember the first few months of starting primary school, my mum told me I was different. If anyone said anything about being Aboriginal, I was to tell her immediately. My mother didn't go into much detail, but I did know at a young age that she was taken from her own mother and so I assumed that she was fearful of us being taken from her too. I did everything just \"right\". I stayed quiet in class until I was asked something. My uniform was pristine. My hair was clean, and I remember being conscious of no dirt being under my nails. I had to be the \"good girl\", to not give them a reason. My parents both worked, and I would help make sure everything moved along smoothly. I did my homework. I was the helper at home. Upon reflection now I didn't just people-please \u2014 I over achieved. The underlying rationale was if I could just stay ahead of judgement, maybe I'd stay safe. This continued through adolescence and my young adult life. I was the first in my family to finish high school. The first to attend university. The first to earn a decent salary from my education. I became hyper-independent in the process. Moved into my own apartment. Got engaged. Got married. I ticked all the boxes. And then I became a mum. I thought this was the final thing I needed to tick to feel \"complete\", to feel like I had \"made it\". But rather than feeling complete, my anxiety and hyper vigilance became more heightened. No-one was telling me I wasn't a good mum. But my mind, body and spirit didn't believe that. I felt like I had to prove myself constantly \u2014 to midwives, doctors, maternal health nurses, other mums. I over-prepared for appointments. I smiled when I wanted to cry. I made sure my baby's clothes were always clean, her bottles lined up, the house spotless when anyone came over. I thought this was just being organised \u2014 until I started breaking down over the small things, like forgetting to buy formula. Then I felt guilty about formula feeding and inadequate that I couldn't breastfeed. It just felt like I was constantly getting smashed by waves knocking me down. I would come up for a gasp of air and then something else would happen. At first, I thought it was just new mum stress. Or hormones. Or maybe I was just being a perfectionist and trying to grab on to control. Just a few days out of hospital and I was already striving to be the perfect mum and beating myself up when I felt that I fell short.(Supplied: Carlie Schofield) But underneath all the to-do lists and late-night googling to seek reassurance that I was doing everything \"right\", was something deeper: A fear of being seen as not good enough. And not just in the \"I want to be a great mum\" way \u2014 but in the \"what if they think I'm not fit to be a mum\" way. I was terrified that if I struggled, someone might step in. That I would be judged too quickly, too harshly, like my grandmother who had her only daughter taken from her. I didn't just want to do it right \u2014 I needed to. Sometimes, it looks like being so afraid of failing your baby that you burn yourself out trying to prevent it. As a therapist with over a decade experience, I knew that something wasn't right. But I did everything to cover up exactly how I was feeling, even lying in filling out the Edinburgh Scale (the postnatal mental health screener) because I was scared of what honesty might bring. Yes, I had postpartum anxiety. But it was shaped by so much more than biology or personality. It was shaped by culture. By generational fear. By the reality that Aboriginal children arestill removed from their familiesat alarming rates. Perfectionism isn't always about ego \u2014 sometimes it's about protection. When I gave myself the permission and space to connect with my spirituality and culture, I was able to reflect more on my experiences and that was a huge shift for me. Realising that my people-pleasing wasn't weakness \u2014 it was a trauma response. Realising that my desire to \"do everything right\" wasn't solely about ambition \u2014 it was about keeping my family together. Realising that my people-pleasing wasn't a weakness but a trauma response was a key moment in my healing and my parenting journey.(Supplied: Justin Huntsdale) Healing didn't come in one moment. It came slowly. In letting go of the need to perform. In giving myself permission to be messy. In surrounding myself with safe people. In connecting myself in culture and surrounding myself with like-minded people. And it came in realising that my worth \u2014 and my children's safety \u2014 doesn't come from perfection. It comes from love. From community. From being seen \u2014 not judged \u2014 in my full humanity. As a therapist and coach, I work with so many mothers who are burned out, anxious, overwhelmed \u2014 and underneath that is a familiar fear: \"I don't want to get it wrong.\" Network 10 presenter Narelda Jacobs and midwife Cherisse Buzzacott open up about their experiences of motherhood. For Aboriginal mothers, that fear often runs even deeper. We all deserve to mother from love, not fear. And our babies deserve to see us whole \u2014 not perfect. We get to be the cycle breakers and pass on the gift of emotional, cultural and spiritual wealth.

        "raw_text": "From cottage cheese TikTok trends to protein-rich ice cream, it seems we're more conscious about protein than ever. It can make it hard to distinguish what sources of protein are good for us and how much we really need. Food and nutrition scientist Emma Beckett, based in Newcastle/Awabakal, believes the current protein obsession is being driven by gym culture, and an increased interest in weight loss and perimenopause/menopause health. \"One of the challenges with the hype around protein is there's not really a very good distinction betweenprotein-rich foods, protein supplements, or protein fortified foods,\" she says. Dr Emma Beckett says some protein products can be highly processed so choosing food first is best.(Supplied: Dr Emma Beckett) Let's break it down: Tracy Hardy, a Gamilaroi woman who specialises in nutrition and dietetics for First Nations Australians, saysfocusing on protein alone in our diets could lead to a lack of macronutrient balance. The macronutrient balance is about what percentage of our energy should come fromcarbs, what percentage should come fromfat, and what percentage should come fromprotein. \"While protein is an important nutrient, these [diet] trends can risk overconsumption and risk neglecting adequate consumption of other macronutrients (fats and carbohydrates), micronutrients and fibre,\" Ms Hardy says. How much protein we should be consuming each day depends on several factors like age, activity level, and overall health. Eat for Health's nutrient calculatorcan help you work out what's right for you based on the national Recommended Dietary Guidelines (RDI). Our expertsrecommend choosing \"food first\" to meet your recommended intake. \"The healthiest foods won't have a label to put that kind of claim on,\" Dr Beckett says. First Nations nutritionist Tracy Hardy says bushfoods such as kangaroo meat can be good sources of protein.(Supplied: Tracy Hardy) \"Remembering the kind of staples of high protein foods as the first port of call, and then maybe adding the fortified foods and supplements, if you're struggling to get that balance with the foods first.\" Ms Hardy, from Sunshine Coast/Kabi Kabi land, says native bush foods, a traditional food source for First Nations peoples, can also be a great source of protein. \"There is a variety of protein-rich bush foods, including (but not limited to)kangaroo, wallaby, magpie geese, fish, wattleseed, bush tomatoes, bush banana, and some legumes,\" Ms Hardy says. She says consumers can connect with First Nations bush food growers and sellers to properly identify and prepare bush foods so they are safe for consumption. \"It's important to connect with local traditional custodians to learn the stories and sustainability of these foods.\" If you're looking to get more protein at mealtimes, our experts recommend: There's plenty of reasons for us to learn how to enjoy kangaroo \u2014 from its unique flavour and low fat content, to its environmental credentials as a more sustainable meat. Our experts say there's a myth that you can't gain weight from eating too much protein. \"You most definitely can,\" Dr Beckett says. \"We need to be eating the protein and doing the weight-bearing exercise. Looking for trusted sources of information when it comes to protein is also recommended. \"Don't go the influencer route, because you definitely don't know where that information is coming from,\" Dr Beckett says. Guidelines from the government's Eat for Health includes information on therecommended daily protein intakefor your age, gender and whether you're pregnant or breastfeeding.

This year's Reconciliation Week theme is, \"Be a voice for generations.\" \"But [Reconciliation] Week in particular is a chance for all Australians to get involved.\" Reconciliation is \"about strengthening relationships between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and non-Indigenous peoples,\" according to Reconciliation Australia. The theme for 2025 is \"Bridging Now to Next\", prompting Australians to look ahead and continue to push forward towards a more united and respectful nation, with past lessons as guidance. Here's how you can get involved at home, in your community and workplace. The week begins afterNational Sorry Dayand marksthe anniversary ofthe 1967 referendum, held on May 27, where Australians voted to change how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were referred to in the constitution. It concludes with another anniversary, withJune 3, 1992markingthe Mabo decision, where a High Court ruling overturned the legal concept of terra nullius \u2014 that land was owned by no-one prior to white settlement. Ms Mundine recommends checking if local First Nations organisations are hosting events, such as open days. \"Cultural tours of your town or city are also a great way to learnmore about the Country you're on and its rich history.\" Gunditjmara woman Catherine Coysh is the program manager of On-Country Pathways and says \"the best way to get to know Aboriginal culture is to seek it from your local Aboriginal community and make genuine relationships.\" TheNational Reconciliation Week calendarcan help you find events and activities near you. Catherine Coysh says it's fairly easy to find a contact for local First Nations groups and communities.(Supplied: On-Country Pathways) For groups, Ms Mundine recommends checking out theReconciliation Film Club, which helps members of the community screen documentaries by First Nations filmmakers. The club can provide access to a recommended film with a fee going directly to the producers of the documentary. The Reconciliation NSW team at the Yabun Festival, including Carly Bush (centre).(Supplied: Reconciliation NSW) For smaller groups or going solo, picking upa book from a First Nations authorcan \"broaden perspectives and understanding\". Carly Bush, the CEO of Reconciliation NSW says this also applies topodcasts and social media. \"Doing some of your own personal learning is always the best place to start.\" \"I look at [Reconciliation Week] as an opportunity to reflect on the history of the country and also around genuine engagement and working and talking to First Nations people,\" says Christian Lugnan, a Gumbaynggirr and Dhanggati Goori man and deputy CEO of Children's Ground. From a business or corporate perspective, Mr Lugnan says toconsider how you engage with community. For instance, \"do you understand the location [and] the history of the location where you're operating from?\" Christian Lugnan is the Deputy CEO of Children's Ground and lives on Larrakia Country in Darwin.(Supplied: Children's Ground) This can also extend to whetheryou provide employment and training opportunitiesandif there are First Nations businesses in your supply chains. Mr Lugnan also encourages businesses toconsider developing aReconciliation Action Plan(RAP)if they haven't got one. For ones that do, Ms Bush from Reconciliation NSW says it may bean opportunity for the business to review and discuss the commitments made. She says tobe mindful of where the cultural load is falling. Ms Coysh says there \"needs to bean ongoing commitment to cultural safety\" in workplaces. Cultural safety is something she helps businesses that partner with On-Country Pathways with. It includesbeing aware of unconscious bias, andnot challenging someone's cultural identity, which can leave them feeling unwelcome or unsafe, she says. Mr Lugnan says to be mindful that Reconciliation Week can be a difficult time for First Nations people because there can be an increase in negative commentary online. Mr Lugnan also suggests taking genuine interest in community, elders andlearning some local language. \"When you're speaking the language of a particular Country, the Country is listening and \u2026 when you're speaking the language you're respecting the ancestors from that Country. \"Local people feel and hear that,\" he says. The beautiful positive of this campaign is that so many allies\u00a0have put in the effort to find out the correct First Nations place name for where they live and work. Underlying all the ways to be involved in Reconciliation Week, Ms Mundine says is \"knowing where you stand\". \"Ask yourself: Whose Country am I on? What's the shared history of this place and what is my community's relationship to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples?\" Ms Mundine says you can get involved by speaking up \"if you hear something ignorant, hurtful or wrong\". \"Commit to being actively anti-racistand ask yourself the hard questions about the role and impact of racism in our society.\" For people looking to do or learn more beyond the week, there are a range of resources Reconciliation Australia suggests. For example, Ms Mundine says to \"read, watch or listen to First Nations media\" or to refer to theAustralian Museum resourcesto learn more about Australia's frontier wars.",

A therapist suggested scheduling sex might help. \"I actually did put it in my calendar every Tuesday and Thursday, but funnily enough it didn't actually result in us having sex at all, and just increased the tension and resentment,\" says 34-year-old Dani, who asked we don't use her real name. She says the strategy, which had also been suggested by a friend, didn't help uncover the unmet emotional needs and lack of desire that were blocking intimacy. \"There were much deeper issues that couldn't be solved by scheduling sex.\" The concept of scheduling sex can be helpful for couples who need to make time and space for intimacy, says Kassandra Mourikis, a sex therapist based in Melbourne/Naarm. \"But it doesn't always hit the mark,\" she says, adding \"it's often too simplistic for what is really going on\". \"The most prominent criticism of scheduling sex is that it creates pressure and expectation.\" We look at what else needs to happen to make scheduling sex effective \u2014 and what can you try if it doesn't work for you. We explore why people have sex without desire, and the possible outcomes of doing so. Lacking intimacy or mismatched desire are two of the most common issues among couples, especially those in long-term relationships, says Tanya Koens, a sexologist and relationship counsellor based in the Northern Rivers/Bundjalung Nation. \"The longer we are together, the busier we get \u2026 the more life we do together, the more difficult it gets to take that nice, intentional, intimate time together. \"Unless people prioritise sex, they don't get to it.\" Ms Mourikis says there are other reasons sex may start to decline in a relationship, including \"body-based changes\" or the type of sex someone is wanting to have shifting. In some cases, scheduling sex can really work for people, says Ms Mourikis. \"Planning it can mean you can prepare for it, and you can look forward to it, and get yourself ready for it.\" Kassandra Mourikis is a sex therapist based in Melbourne/Naarm.(Supplied) She says even in early dating, we plan for sex more than we realise. \"There are often elements of scheduling and planning and preparing even in early dating times. \"You shave your body, have a shower, put on nice underwear, make sure you have space at home, have the time \u2026 there's a fair bit of stuff happening in the background.\" Scheduling sex is most likely to work for people who know their own boundaries and how to check in with themselves, Ms Mourikis says. \"They feel they are able to advocate for themselves and can say no [if they don't feel like sex].\" Ms Koens says the longer a couple is together, the more likely they are to experienceresponsive desire over spontaneous desire. Meaning, more effort needs to go into building arousal and sexual desire in the lead-up to sex. Ms Koens notes if there is a power imbalance in the relationship, scheduling sex \"can be abused\". \"If it's a demand, 'We must have sex on Wednesday', that's treating it like a work meeting,\" Ms Koens says. Having a low sex drive isn't necessarily an issue. But if you want to up it, there are several things you might not have considered. She says we are all responsible for our own sexual needs. \"Even if you are married in monogamous relationship, you are not responsible for a partner's sexual needs.\" Sexual coercion involves behaviour that is not always criminal, but isusually abusive in some way. For help you can contact1800 RESPECT, the national body for supporting people impacted by sexual assault, domestic or family violence and abuse. Scheduling intimacy doesn't have to lead to sex, but should be an activity that \"narrows the gap\", says Ms Koens.(Pexels) For some people, scheduling sex will \"kill desire\", says Ms Mourikis. \"When there is an expectation that you will have sex an 8pm on a Wednesday night, but you are feeling really tired or not really feeling like sex, instead of curiosity and excitement, there is anxiety and dread. \"That can reinforce this anxiety and avoidance cycle.\" Ms Koens says we need to be curious about what is getting in the way of sex, or what would make ourselves and our partner feel sexier. \"It's OK to not know what you like, or your partner likes, but what we need is to be curious about that. \"If we are curious, we are going to learn a bunch of stuff.\" She says scheduling intimacy, rather than sex, can be an easier place to start. \"When I talk to people about the diary, I say 'You are happy to put the kids' soccer and drinks after work and that meeting and seeing your parents [in there], but not prioritise what is going on with your partner'. \"Plan to be spontaneous.\" First comes the decision, then comes the excitement which is followed by the pressure and, sometimes, overwhelming disappointment. The activity should be something that \"narrows the gap\" to sex, Ms Koens says. \"It's time to hang out. That could be taking a shower together, giving one person a massage this week then the other the next, watching TV in your underwear or naked, or touching. \"It's up to you \u2026 [whatever] makes it a little easier to step across the chasm if it's been a long time. \"You're not failing if you don't have sex.\" Ms Mourikis says quality time together, with no interruptions like phones and children, creates a \"context for desire to grow\". If putting sex on the calendar makes you feel uneasy, Ms Mourikis suggests listening to that. \"It's OK to say, 'I'm not sure about this'. \"Lots of people are taught to ignore their bodies and that their body's signals are not trustworthy because of lots of normative forces that say you must have sex to be a good partner.\" Ms Mourikis says when you give yourself room to not want sex, or change your mind, you might actually experience more desire. \"They need to prioritise things that feel pleasurable, that they are curious about, and let responsive desire flow from there.\" Talking to your partner about what you do and don't like about scheduling intimacy might lead to learning what does work for you both, Ms Mourikis says. \"Have a conversation and check in around it. Asking things like 'What's your perspective around scheduling sex? When could it feel useful for us?' \"Maybe when you do feel pressure, ask 'What could we do differently?\" She says some people might say we tried it, and it didn't work. Or, these adjustments would make it better, for example. Tanya Koens says couples would benefit from being more curious about their own, and each other's, sexual needs and desires.(Supplied) Ms Koens says the advice around scheduling sex needs to come with nuance. \"I wouldn't suggest it for people who can't communicate or where there is resentment. \"For them I would suggest a meeting where they can share what they like about each other, what they like about themselves, what they would like to make an apology for, and making a request.\" She says that approach can help people clear out what has been operating beneath the surface. This is general information only. For personal advice, you should seek professional support.",

        "raw_text": "Warning: This story contains details of sexual abuse and domestic violence. A former top aide to Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has testified that the hip-hop mogul threatened to kill her during her first day on the job and waved a gun as he kidnapped her years later in an angry rush to find and kill rapper Kid Cudi. Capricorn Clark's account of Mr Combs's volatility and violence on Tuesday launched the third week of testimony at the singer's Manhattan federal sex trafficking trial. Prosecutors called Ms Clark, the former global brand director for Mr Combs's Bad Boy Entertainment, to support a charge that he led a two-decade racketeering conspiracy that relied on beefy bodyguards, death threats and the silence of frightened staff to ensure he got what he wanted. Mr Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to an indictment alleging he abused his longtime girlfriend, R&B singer Cassie, and others. If convicted, he could face 15 years to life in prison. Ms Clark's tearful testimony came days after Kid Cudi, whose legal name is Scott Mescudi, testified that Ms Clark called him from a car outside his home in December 2011 and told him Mr Combs had forced her to accompany him to Mr Mescudi's house. Rapper Kid Cudi arrives to testify at the Diddy trial in Manhattan on May 22.(Reuters: David 'Dee' Delgado) Mr Combs was angry that Mr Mescudi was dating Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, Ms Clark said. Ms Clark, referring to Mr Combs as \"Puff\" after his former stage name, Puff Daddy, said he came to her home holding a gun and demanded she get dressed because \"we're going to kill Cudi\". Her voice shaky, Ms Clark recounted how they rode in a black Cadillac Escalade to Mr Mescudi's Los Angeles home, where Mr Combs and his bodyguard entered the residence while Ms Clark sat in the SUV and called Ms Ventura. Ms Clark testified she told Ms Ventura that Mr Combs \"got me with a gun and brought me to Cudi's house to kill him\". Ms Clark said she heard Mr Mescudi in the background asking: \"He's in my house?\" She said she told Ms Ventura, \"Stop him, he's going to get himself killed\". Ms Ventura told her she could not stop Mr Mescudi, she recalled. Mr Combs returned to the Escalade and asked Ms Clark who she was talking to, she said, then grabbed the phone and called Ms Ventura back. They next heard Mr Mescudi driving up the road, Ms Clark said. Mr Combs and his bodyguard got back in the SUV and chased after Mr Mescudi, finally giving up when they passed police cars that were heading to Mr Mescudi's house. Disgraced hip-hop mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs always knew how to attract attention but he probably never anticipated the circus that now surrounds him at his criminal trial. After the break-in, Ms Clark said, Mr Combs told her she had to convince Mr Mescudi, \"it wasn't me\". \"If you don't convince him of that, I'll kill all you,\" he said, punctuating his threat with an expletive, Ms Clark said. Ms Clark said she and Ms Ventura then went to Mr Mescudi's home, telling jurors: \"We needed to talk to him. We needed to make sure he wasn't going to make a police report about Puff.\" After that, she said, she watched in shock as Mr Combs viciously assaulted Ms Ventura over her relationship with Mr Mescudi. Mr Combs kicked Mr Mescudi with \"100 per cent full force\" to the legs and back as she curled on the ground outside his home in a foetal position and wept silently, Ms Clark said. Ms Clark said her \"heart was breaking from seeing her get hit like that\" and that neither she nor Mr Combs's bodyguard intervened. The answer prompted an objection from Mr Combs's lawyers, and Judge Arun Subramanian told jurors to disregard it. Mr Combs's lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, questioned Ms Clark's recollection, leading her to reconsider certain details. She admitted some haziness about events that happened \"such a long time ago\". Cassie Ventura and Sean Combs at the 2018 Met Gala in New York City.(Getty: John Shearer) On Thursday, Mr Mescudi testified that he dated Ms Ventura briefly in December 2011, believing she had broken up with Mr Combs, but they agreed over the holidays to break up. Assistant US Attorney Mitzi Steiner questioned Ms Clark about her off-and-on employment with Mr Combs from 2004 to 2018, beginning with her first day, when, she said, Mr Combs and a bodyguard took her to Central Park after 9pm and said he had not been aware of her past work for other rappers. Ms Clark testified that Mr Combs told her that if that work became an issue, he would have to kill her. Ms Clark said she was only weeks into the job when Mr Combs tasked her with carrying diamond jewellery and it went missing. As a result, she said, she was repeatedly given lie detector tests over a five-day stretch by a man who seemed five times larger than her own size. \"He said: 'If you fail this test, they're going to throw you in the East River,'\" she recalled, adding that they eventually let her return to work. Even the alleged kidnapping did not scare Ms Clark away, Mr Agnifilo noted. Last year, after federal agents raided Mr Combs's homes, she suggested returning to his employment as his chief of staff. Mr Combs rejected the offer, Mr Agnifilo said. AP",

        "raw_text": "Most women in 19th-century Europe were encouraged to learn the piano as a way to attract husbands, but it was never intended that they would pursue a career in music. Despite these constraints, Clara Wieck Schumann became a concert pianist and composer. Clara Schumann gave her debut concert when she was nine years old. \"She was really a pioneer with so many things,\" says Australian pianist Andrea Lam, one of the judges in the newABC iview series The Piano. Many are still inspired by Schumann\u2019s life story and music today. Born in Leipzig, Germany in 1819, Schumann made her debut when she was nine years old. She later married fellow pianist and composer Robert Schumann, becoming his musical partner and staunchest advocate. After her husband\u2019s death, Schumann supported her family by touring as a concert pianist, teaching students and mentoring younger composers. Some became lifelong friends. Voting now in the Classic 100: Piano. Tell us your favourites and we'll count down Australia's top 100 choices across June 7 and 8 on ABC Classic and the ABC listen app. Clara Schumann\u2019s father, Friedrich Wieck, was a self-taught musician who sold pianos and ran a music-lending library. Her mother was a well-known singer and pianist as well as Schumann\u2019s first teacher. When the couple separated, Schumann remained under her father\u2019s custody. Wieck devised his own methods to teach the piano, and Schumann was his model student, who he used to shore up his reputation. Her daily routine was planned to the minute. Wieck would give his daughter a one-hour lesson on the piano as well as violin, singing, theory, harmony, composition, and counterpoint. On top of this, Schumann was expected to do an extra two-hours practise on her own. In later life, Schumann wrote: \"[My father] was exceedingly strict, that he reprimanded me when I deserved it and in so doing, prevented me from becoming arrogant from the praise the world showered on me.\" Her future husband Robert Schumann was impressed with Schumann's talent after seeing her perform as a nine-year-old. He took lessons from her father, living in their house for a year. By her mid-teens, Schumann had toured all over Europe to perform piano recitals under her father\u2019s management. \"Recitals, where people bought tickets to hear a pianist or [other instrumentalists] perform in a public auditorium, were a new concept in the 19th century,\"says Andrew Ford,host of The Music Show. Schumann was admired for her musical interpretations, which she played from memory, unlike most of her fellow performers. One Austrian poet even wrote a poem called \"Clara Wieck and Beethoven\" after hearing her play the Appassionata Piano Sonata. Schumann\u2019s relationship with her father broke down when he refused to give her permission to marry Robert Schumann, resulting in months-long legal battles. The young couple won their case in court and married a day before Schumann's 21st birthday in 1840. Schumann premiered her first piano concerto at the age of 16 under the baton of renowned composer Felix Mendelssohn. Robert and Clara Schumann often composed together in the early years of their marriage(Getty: Hulton Archive) After their marriage, Robert and Clara collaborated musically for many years. But Robert\u2019s physical and mental health deteriorated soon after. Touring to Russia in 1844 exhausted him. As Robert continued to decline, Clara began to take the role of the family\u2019s breadwinner through performing and teaching. Robert committed himself to a mental asylum in 1854 and died two years later, leaving Clara a single mother of seven children. Schumann reforged her earlier career as a concert pianist, giving public performances at home and overseas. Ford says: \"The idea that you can buy a ticket to sit in a large auditorium listening to a great pianist play Bach or Beethoven owes a lot to Clara Schumann.\" Schumann was the first performer for many of her husband\u2019s compositions. In later life, she premiered many piano pieces by Johannes Brahms, who became a close friend of the family. There are over 1,300 preserved concert programs which detail the music she performed in recitals between 1831\u20131889. Although Schumann did much to champion other composer\u2019s music, even making them staples of classical music concerts, her own compositions were rarely performed after her death. But Schumann is far from being forgotten. In Germany, there are streets named after her in Berlin, Leipzig and other cities. Before the introduction of the Euro in 2002, Schumann was featured in one of Germany\u2019s notes for the 100 Deutsche Mark. \"She\u2019s not lost, but I think she needed to be rediscovered,\" says British pianist Isata Kanneh-Mason. Stream the Classic 100 in Concert on Saturday 21 June from 7.30 pm on ABC TV and ABC iview. To mark Schumann's 200 birthday in 2019, Kanneh-Mason recorded an album of her music, including the piano concerto Schumann premiered as a young woman. That same year, her birth town in Leipzig organised a festival to honour her life and music. The town had a memorial plaque to mark the place where she was born, and her marital home is now a museum and music school dedicated to both Clara and Robert Schumann. Kanneh-Mason was inspired by Schumann\u2019s life story when she chose to record her music. \"Not only did she manage to sustain a long and demanding concert career, she also raised a large family and dealt with inconceivable tragedies,\" Kanneh-Mason says. Schumann also has a young torch-bearer in ABC iview's The Piano. Just like Schumann, \"I practise everyday,\" says 12-year-old Stefania, one of the younger performers in the series. \"I think of the piano as an extension of my soul and body,\" Stefania says. After wowing judges Harry Connick Jr and Andrea Lam with her flawless performance of Bach's English Suite No. 2, Stefania was invited to perform for the Finale concert. Stefania performs music by Clara Schumann in The Piano's finale, mentored by Lam, who herself was a prodigy, debuting with the Sydney Symphony aged just 13. \"It's really important to be able to identify with your idols and with people that you respect,\" Lam says.

        "raw_text": "Pete Murray would prefer it if you didn't stream one of his biggest hits. The Australian musician has been in the industry for more than 20 years, and his hit single Better Days is one of his most recognisable songs. But recently, he announced that he'd prefer fans not to play the original song, because he has a new version available. In April,Murray announced on social mediathat he was releasing a new version of Better Days (Pete's Version), and that he was now an independent artist, rather than signed to a label. \"You might not be aware that I don't actually own a lot of my older, classic songs,\" he wrote. Australian musician Pete Murray believes it's important for musicians to own their masters.(Supplied: Ian Laidlaw) \"I believe it's important for all artists to own their own recordings, and so this is the first of a series of 'Pete's Versions' of some of my biggest songs that I'll be releasing in the coming years.\" Sound familiar? Musicians re-recording and releasing new versions of their work isn't new. Taylor Swift's re-recording projectis one of the most well-known examples of this. And many musicians have been emboldened to follow her lead. \"Taylor did it and I was thinking, 'Wow, that's how you do it,'\" Murray says. In 2019, Swift's former label, Big Machine Records,announced that the company had been acquired by businessman Scooter Braun's Ithica Holdings. This deal sparked years of discourse about the rights of musicians when it comes to owning their work. Dr Karl knows the best app for free podcasts, radio, music, news and audiobooks \u2026 and you don't need to be a scientist to find it! Swift, one of the world's biggest pop stars, was quick to express her anger over the move as it meant her original masters were sold to Braun. \"Scooter has stripped me of my life's work, that I wasn't given an opportunity to buy. Essentially, my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it,\"she wrotein a lengthy statement on Tumblr. Swift left Big Machine Records in 2018 and signed to Republic Records, owned by Universal Music, in a joint deal with Taylor Swift Productions. Following the public battle with Braun, Swift began releasing re-recorded versions of her six previous albums. These new albums were identified as 'Taylor's Version', so fans could support Swift and the purpose of her re-recording project. It's a move that music journalist Nic Kelly says empowered Swift's fans to protest on her behalf. Musicians re-recording their work in a bid to claim ownership back feels modern, but Swift wasn't the first. The Everly Brothers were superstars in the 1950s, and the duo had two studio albums with Cadence Records. But when their contract expired in 1960, they left and were signed to Warner Brothers Records. The deal, worth US$1 million, was the biggest record deal in music history at the time. The Everly Brothers' $US1 million deal with Warner went on to be a catalyst for stricter recording contracts.(Facebook: The Everly Brothers) Under Warner, the Everly Brothers released a studio album in 1964, The Very Best of The Everly Brothers, which included not only their hits recorded under Warner, but re-recorded versions of their earlier hits originally released with Cadence. Legally, there was no restriction on them re-recording. And it meant the re-recorded versions of their hit songs were competing with their first two records owned by Cadence. The label struggled to compete and eventually closed in 1964. Thanks to this, the risk of artists re-recording their old songs was identified, and soon clauses were added to contracts to avoid this happening in the future. So how can musicians today, like Swift and Murray, re-record their previous work if they don't own the masters? Joshua Yuvaraj, a senior law lecturer at the University of Auckland, says it's complicated. 1989 (Taylor's Version) is here, revisiting Taylor Swift's incredibly successful turn at pop music. For some, it's the album that turned them into Swifties. For others, 1989 marks her most strategic marketing era. For artists like Swift and Murray, who write their own music, it can come down to who owns the master recording of the original work, and who owns the copyright to the song. \"There are two different copyrights \u2026 One is when the artist writes the song, there is a copyright applied to that. \"But there's also a copyright in the recording when the song is made in the studio with the artist, the producers and so on,\" Yuvaraj says. The master is often owned by the recording label, while the composition (melody and lyrics) is copyrighted separately. Murray knows this law all too well, and he was forced to wait five years after his contract ended before he could start re-recording and re-releasing his earlier songs. The deal Murray signed nearly 20 years ago meant his record label owns his masters. It meant the masters recording was paid for by the label, and it put Murray into debt with the record company that took his entire contract to pay back. Pete Murray grew up thinking he'd work in sports medicine, and never dreamed of writing and recording his own songs. He finally picked up a guitar when he was 22. He realised that in order to earn enough money to cover those costs, he would need to keep touring. \"I was at a point where I'd have to call my agent and say 'I need more money, book me more shows'. \"I thought, 'If I don't change this soon, I'm going to be doing this for the rest of my life',\" he says. He does receive small royalties from those masters today, but he still doesn't own them. \"That was the hard thing to accept \u2026 I just thought 'It's not really a fair deal'.\" Journalist Nic Kelly says the publicity around artists taking a stand has prompted change. \"We are seeing a massive shift towards artists retaining their independence, retaining ownership of an autonomy over the way they're perceived, and the way that they are marketed. He says that historically many recording contracts included large profit cuts for the label and not the musician. \"A lot of it [the cut] can be 85 per cent \u2026 and it doesn't feel like the record label does 85 per cent of the work. \"The cut these record labels take from some of these deals is enormous and doesn't feel justifiable,\" he says. In recent years, more well-known musicians have come forward with their record label horror stories. When Chappell Roan won her first-ever Grammy award for best new artist earlier this year, she took the opportunity to campaign for better working conditions for emerging musicians. Chappell Roan used her first Grammy win as an opportunity to advocate for better conditions for young musicians under contract with record companies.(Getty Images) \"I would demand that labels in the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists would offer a liveable wage and health care, especially to developing artists,\" she said. Joshua Yuvaraj says while there are clearly systemic issues within the industry, he believes healthy dialogue is crucial. \"Without demonising these record companies and streaming companies that do play vital roles in the creative ecosystem, we also need to acknowledge that artists need to be taken care of,\" he says. With more high-profile cases of re-recording occurring in recent years, some record companies have responded. It was reportedin 2023 that major labels such as Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group were overhauling their contracts for new artists. These updates to contracts allegedly included longer periods before re-recording would be allowed, with some timeframes reportedly up to 30 years. Kelly isn't surprised. \"It shows that they're definitely feeling the impacts of these re-recordings and loss of income.\" Music journalist Nic Kelly believes we are witnessing a cultural shift in the music industry for young artists.(Instagram: @nickelly.mp3 / Photo: Ashley Mar.) He says it reflects the deeper wounds between some artists and record labels. \"It raises the bigger question for me of, 'Why do artists want to re-record in the first place?' and that onus comes down to the communication between artist teams and record labels. \"The label does need to make money, so they can re-invest into developing new talent. \"I think that's a good ecosystem, but it should be fair for everyone.\" Murray believes there's room for improvement across the music industry. \"How many artists have tried to sue the record label over years of trying to get out of deals because the deals have been terrible?\" he says. He wishes he could have given his younger self some advice. \"I believe that you should own your master \u2026 because you control it and you own it. \"No one can take it from you.\" He says if labels prioritise fairer deals, the long-term results will be beneficial.",

        "raw_text": "Dave Shapiro, a heavy metal music executive who was the US talent representative for a slew of Australian musicians, has died in a San Diego plane crash. The 42-year-old was listed as the owner of the plane that crashed, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. His agency website said he managed Australian bands including Parkway Drive, Amity Affliction and Northlane. The music agency Sound Talent Group confirmed Shapiro, as well as two employees and the former drummer for metal band The Devil Wears Prada, died in the crash on Thursday morning, local time. \"We are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends,\" the agency said in a statement. Shapiro co-founded Sound Talent Group with Tim Borror and Matt Andersen in 2018. A vehicle left damaged by the San Diego plane crash.(AP: Gregory Bull) The agency's roster focuses on alternative bands but has included pop acts such as Hanson and Vanessa Carlton. The members of Byron Bay band Parkway Drive paid tribute to Shapiro, saying they were \"heartbroken\" over the loss of their \"good friend\" and US booking agent. \"We send all our love and support to Dave's family, friends, and the team at Sound Talent Group during this extremely difficult time,\" they wrote in an Instagram statement. \"Our thoughts and condolences are also with the live ones of Daniel Williams and the extended music community.\" Fellow Australian band Yours Truly, which Shapiro also represented, reposted a triple j post, writing: \"Thank you for everything, rest in peace.\" Shapiro was included in Billboard's 2012 30 Under 30 list recognising rising stars in entertainment. Industry veterans said Shapiro paved the way for the formation of other independent agencies and helped many alternative bands find audiences in the mainstream. He was also a flight enthusiast, at one point opening an office of his talent agency at a hangar in San Diego. Flying \"helps me focus and helps me not be distracted by all the nonsense in the world, and whatever's going on outside the plane kind of doesn't matter in those moments,\" Shapiro said in a 2020 podcast interview. Dave Shapiro was listed as the owner of the plane that crashed into a San Diego neighbourhood.(AP: Gregory Bull) Shapiro owned a flight school called Velocity Aviation and a record label named Velocity Records. Sum 41 singer Deryck Whibley credited Shapiro with helping build the rock band back up during a \"low point\" in its career. Ahead of their last conversation, Shapiro flew in his new plane to see Sum 41's induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in March. He promised Whibley he would come back. \"Me and my wife, we're going to fly to you,\" Whibley recalled Shapiro saying to him. \"We're going to pick you up and we're going to go somewhere crazy for lunch.\" National Transportation Safety Board investigator Dan Baker said officials would work over the next year to determine what caused Shapiro's Cessna 550 Citation to crash. Early investigations show that the runway lights had been out at the airport where the aircraft planned to land. A weather alert system that should have warned of heavy fog was also not working. The pilot reportedly acknowledged the weather conditions for landing at the small airport were not ideal and debated diverting to a different airport while discussing the visibility with an air traffic controller, according to audio of the conversation posted by LiveATC.net. Early investigations show the runway lights at the San Diego airport were out.(AP: Gregory Bull) Ultimately, the pilot is heard saying that he will stick with the plan to land at Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport. \"Doesn't sound great but we'll give it a go,\" he tells the air traffic controller. The plane crashed into a US Navy housing\u00a0neighbourhood\u00a0about 3.22 kilometres from the airport. No-one in the neighbourhood\u00a0was killed but eight people were treated for smoke inhalation and non-life-threatening injuries. ABC/AP",

A statement at the time said doctors expected him to make a full recovery. It is unclear if his medical issues at the time were related to normal pressure hydrocephalus. The condition can cause problems with walking, bladder control and thinking, and the symptoms can worsen if the illness is left untreated. It is relatively rare and can be hard to diagnose. Billy Joel recently revealed he had undergone surgery.(Supplied: Facebook) It can be treated successfully with surgery to install a tube to drain excess fluid.

Shares in Nvidia rose 4 per cent in extended trading on Wall Street as the impact of US chip export restrictions was less than some analysts had feared. See how the day unfolded. Disclaimer: this blog is not intended as investment advice. By Nadia Daly Prices current around 4:33pm AEST Live updates from major ASX indices: By Nadia Daly Investors were feeling optimistic today following news a US court blocked President Donald Trump from using emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs on imports. TheASX 200closed0.2% higherat 8409 points, with half the sectors in positive territory and the others, led by real estate, in the red: As we reported just earlier, Asian markets have surged and US futures for tomorrow are pointing skywards too, with traders breathing a sigh of relief that the tariffs - which rocked global markets - look set to be scrapped (even though the US President said he would appeal the decision). The price ofgoldhas been falling, -0.5% to US$3272 an ounce currently. Meanwhile brent crudeoilhas jumped this afternoon, +1.5% to US$65.88 a barrel. That's all from us at the biz team blog. Thanks for your company on a busy markets day By Nadia Daly US markets look set for a strong day of trade tomorrow, with futures for all major indices pointing up. At 3:55pm AEST futures for the Dow Jones were up 1.4%, the S&P500 +1.7% and the Nasdaq over 2% higher. Josh Gilbert, Market Analyst at eToro had these comments to make: \"US futures are rallying on the decision by US courts to say Trump\u2019s tariffs are illegal and must be stopped within 10 calendar days. While this is clearly lifting risk sentiment, with thanks as well to Nvidia\u2019s earnings, it once again throws more uncertainty into the ring for investors. We\u2019re now seeing the administration fighting back with an appeal, but what\u2019s clear is this is a serious dent in Trump\u2019s trade war. Although this is a positive for investors in the short term, given the immediate rally we\u2019re seeing, the big question we\u2019ll be asking is, does this end Trump\u2019s rampage on global trade? At this juncture, it seems unlikely. What it does mean is that volatility will likely rise once again in the next 10 days.While investors may see risk as the first place they turn to, given the move higher we\u2019re seeing in equity futures, we\u2019re entering a window of uncertainty. The tariff news flow is changing day-to-day, and that\u2019s a reminder to manage your risk, especially given that it\u2019s far too early to see how this will play out. Still, if this court ruling is upheld, it\u2019s a real tailwind for global risk assets, especially exporters, cyclicals, and supply chain-sensitive sectors.\" By Nadia Daly Another major story we're keeping our eyes on today is the newslate yesterdaythat the government approved an extension of Australia's biggest gas project As energy reporter Daniel Mercer says, \"the decision to extend the life of the gigantic North West Shelf gas plant boils down to one thing\" That one thing, he reports, is Browse - one of the country's biggest untapped resources projects, with gas reserves large enough to meet the equivalent of Australia's entire domestic demand for almost 20 years.

By Nadia Daly The Minister for Trade Don Farrell has confirmed his team is examining the implications on Australia of the US court ruling to scrap President Donald Trump's tariffs. In a statement Mr Farrell told the ABC: \"We will study this ruling of the US Federal Courts on reciprocal tariffs closely and note that they may be subject to further legal processes through the courts. The Albanese Government has been consistent in the view that these tariffs on Australian imports into the US are unjustified. We will continue to engage and strongly advocate for the removal of tariffs. The Albanese Government will always stand up for Australia\u2019s national interests, including Australian jobs and Australian industries.\" By Nadia Daly Markets have been pleased with today's news a US court blocked the so called Liberation Day tariffs (even though the US President says he will appeal), with the ASX 200 up 0.3%, the Shanghai Composite Index up 0.7% and the Nikkei up 1.6% to a more than two-week high. Chip related stocks also rallied (thanks to Nvidia's news of strong sales results), helping to life the Nikkei to 38,288 at 2:55pm AEST. The broader Topix rose 1.4% to 2809. Kyle Rodda, from capital.com said: \"It's massive news. It's long been suggested that the emergency powers Trump has used to implement tariffs were unconstitutional and that the power to enact tariffs sits with Congress.\" \n\"It sets up a battle that will likely end up the Supreme Court now. It's a situation fraught with danger because the administration may ignore the court's ruling, potentially placing greater strain on U.S. institutions at a time of increased stress.\" \n\"However, should the markets get their way, the courts could delay and then deny these tariffs, removing one massive risk and undoubtedly stoking risk appetite.\" While Gary Ng, senior economist with Natixis in Hong Kong said: \"The decision will fuel temporary risk-on sentiment in equities and lower bond yields as the market dials back inflation expectations driven by tariffs. However, this is not the end of the tariff story. There is no clarity as the legal battle will continue and it does not change the fact that Trump will find ways to reshape global trade order.\" Francis Tan, the Chief Asia Strategist from Indosuez Wealth Management added: \"The U.S. dollar itself is quite undervalued because of concerns about U.S. deficits and debt. That should continue for a while until we get more clarity on fiscal issues.\" And Yunosuke Ikeda, the head of macro research at Nomura inTokyo said: \"At this point it's almost impossible to know if the tariffs will be completely unwound by this. But in the hypothetical situation that they are, it's natural to see dollar appreciation. Basically Trump's tariffs will lead to stagflation pressure on the U.S. economy, so reversing those tariffs would be a positive for the dollar.\" By Nadia Daly A lobby group fronted by a prominentBoeingwhistleblower has sent a letter toCEO Kelly Ortberg, claiming the company has not taken adequate steps to address safety issues with its planes, including the737 MAXwhich was involved in two deadly crashes. The Foundation for Aviation Safety was set up by former Boeing engineer and whistleblowerEd Piersonwho penned the letter, claiming that the company has not addresses ongoing concerns raised by whistleblowers like himself about the plane's manufacturing and safety standards. Last month, its CEO appeared before a US senate committee where he was grilled on the company's safety record. The company has been the subject of severalinvestigationsfollowing the fatal crashes, and a third major mid-air incident last year. Last week the company reached a deal with theUS Department of Justiceover the two fatal crashes, which includes a payment ofUS$1.1 billionin fines. Boeing has been contacted by the ABC for comment, but has previously said it has addressed any outstanding safety issues and takes the safety of its planes seriously. By Nassim Khadem Australians are heading into tax time with some kind of worry or anxiety, according to new research by small business platform Xero. Its survey of more than 1,000 Australians also found many were worried about a mistake on their return (54 per cent), owing money to the ATO (33 per cent), following all tax rules correctly (28 per cent) and being audited by the ATO (22 per cent). The research also revealed that many Australians were confused about key tax rules. More than half (51 per cent) admit they are unsure about tax deduction rules \u2014 especially those relating to car, transport and travel expenses (21 per cent) or working from home costs (21 per cent). To learn more about the dos and don'ts this tax time, watch this interview I did with ATO assistant commissioner Rob Thomson: By Nadia Daly With Trump's Tariff fantasy on hold, what happens with the $20 billion that have already been paid in tariffs? - Stan Good question, Stan! One would imagine any importers who have already forked out on tariffs before they were put on ice would be mulling their options currently. Remains to be seen what will happen to those payments if the ban is upheld By Michael Janda We're seeing some expert reaction to the Federal Court of International Trade's ruling thatUS President Donald Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)to impose his Liberation Day tariffs is \"contrary to law\". This fromPaul Ashworth, Capital Economics chief North America economist: \"The Commerce Clause of the US Constitution grants Congress the exclusive power to \"regulate commerce with foreign nations\". Congress has delegated some of those powers to the executive branch over the decades, buttoday's order makes clear that the court thinks Trump exceeded those powers,\" he writes. \"In addition, the court found that Trump was wrong to use trade deficits as a justification for declaring a national emergency. As a result,'the Liberation Day executive orders \"are declared to be invalid as contrary to law.\"This is pretty damning stuff.\" The practical effect of this ruling is to cast doubt on the Liberation Day tariffs \u2014 the blanket 10% minimum and the higher rates for targeted nations \u2014 while appeals continue, probably all the way to the Supreme Court. \"The IEEPA was used as the justification for the reciprocal tariffs imposed on most countries plus the fentanyl-related tariffs imposed on Canada, Mexico and China,\" Ashworth explains. \"Most of the other product-specific tariffs on steel, aluminum and motor vehicles were imposed under the standard trade laws following Section 232 investigations, so will presumably remain in place, for now at least. \"The ruling will obviously throw into disarray the administration's push to quickly seal trade \"deals\"during the 90-day pause from tariffs that have now been declared to be illegal. Other countries will wait and see whether a higher court is willing to reverse this ruling.\" By Nadia Daly Here's a guest post by friend of the blog and ABC business reporter,David Taylor: Businesses aren\u2019t too keen to invest, according to the latest official Bureau of Statistics data. Private new capital expenditure (capex) fell 0.1 per cent in the 2025 March quarter to be 0.5 per cent lower than the 2024 March quarter (seasonally adjusted, chain volume measures). \"Business investment fell 0.9 per cent in the non-mining industries, while the mining industry rose 1.9 per cent,\" Robert Ewing, ABS head of business statistics, said. AMP\u2019s chief economist Shane Oliver called it a \u201cdepressing outcome.\u201d \u201cMost economists, including ourselves, were looking for a modest gain \u2013 I think the consensus was 0.5 per cent.\u201d He said it didn\u2019t bode well for next week\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) data. Plant and equipment spending, the most relevant component for next week\u2019s GDP data declined 1.3% in the March quarter. But JPMorgan remains optimistic today\u2019s business investment result won\u2019t hurt Australia\u2019s overall economic growth picture. \u201c[It\u2019s] weaker than our standing assumption but insufficient to alter our 1Q real GDP tracking estimate of 0.3 per cent.\u201d Building/structures related capex rose a shade under 1 per cent, an outcome aligned with yesterday\u2019s construction work done print.\u201d Across industries, the industries which have had the most upside in capital spending have been information, media and telecommunications which is basically spending on data centres and AI, construction and electricity, gas, water and waste services. The retail sector has gone backwards in terms of capital spending in recent years. AMP\u2019s Shane Oliver also makes the point that business investment is fundamental to boosting productivity, which is also crucial to boost Australians\u2019 living standards. By Nadia Daly As we've been reporting today, a US court has blocked President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, one of his hallmark policies. Global markets have cheered on the ruling, rising in response. US futures are up and the dollar rose against the euro and yen. ITC Markets's Sean Callow said: \"It appears as though while there must be significant caution over the ruling being overturned by higher courts, for now the weight of money is being placed on the possibility that US courts prevent the White House from self-imposed economic damage, brightening US growth prospects and the USD.\" ButJared Mondscheinfrom theUnited States Studies Centresays several avenues remain open for Trump to impose tariffs. Watch his interview with ABC news and read more about today's decision here: By Nadia Daly NABestimates Australians spent$62.55 billionon online retail in the past 12 months, making up14% of total retail trade. The bank's monthly online retail sales index is out and it shows a1.1%rise in seasonally adjusted terms, though a slowdown in year-on-year growth. Month-on-month growth was in the green for all categories except toys and fashion (though NAB noted the large fall in fashion follows two strong months). State-by-state, it was a mixed bag, with growth sluggish in Victoria, Tasmania and the NT, and Queensland rebounded after it recovered from Cyclone Alfred. NAB chief economist Sally Auld commented: \"Online retail sales growth accelerated 1.1% in April, in mom, seasonally adjusted terms. This was much faster than our NAB Monthly Data Insights measure for broader retail (0.2% mom). In growth terms, online has outperformed our broader measure in ten of the past twelve months. The large sales category, department stores, is a clear difference between the online and the broader series \u2013 withonline sales at department stores up solidlyin the month, while our broader retail sales measure for the category contracted for a second month. Also noticeable in both series was the return to growth in QLD, after cyclone Alfred-induced weakness in March. QLD is the third largest state for online retail sales, so a strong contribution to growth for that state helped to counter weakness in VIC in the month.\" By Nadia Daly Prices current around 1:00pm AEST Live updates from major ASX indices: By Nadia Daly The ASX is up a third of a per cent at lunch, following a US federal court ruling to block Donald Trump's tariffs. The All Ords and ASX 200 are up 0.3% at 12:45 AEST Energy and industrials are leading the gains, while the academic and real estate sectors are making the biggest losses. The Australian dollar is buying 64.21 US cents. By Michael Janda It's not just academic and think tank tax experts who are backingthe government's proposed \"Div 296\" tax on superbalances above $3 million. Harry Chemay, a wealth adviser with nearly three decades of experience, haspenned a piece analysing the proposal forFirstlinks, a financial publication now owned by Morningstar. His choice of outlet is interesting, given that many of Firstlinks's readers would have the type ofself-managed super funds (SMSFs)which are the primary target of this tax change. As Chemay points out: \"APRA-regulated funds account for about 94% of all members while holding approximately 76% of system assets. \"SMSFs, by contrast,make up 6% of members but hold some 24% of assets.\" He says the planned change unwinds only some of theincreased super tax concessionsbestowed on high-wealth individualsin the 2006-07 budget handed down by Peter Costello during John Howard's last term in office. Chemay notes that those changes saw thescrapping of the \"Reasonable Benefit Limit\", which was then set at $687,149 for lump sums and $1,356,291 for pensions, beyond which super benefits were taxed at the highest prevailing marginal tax rate. \"Div 296 is trying to repair some of the earnings tax largess that was created in that 2006/07 Budget, which saw an unprecedented amount of wealth flow into the super system prior to 1 July 2007,\" he writes. \"I know this becauseI was an SMSF adviser at the time, and it is to this day the most hectic financial year I've ever experienced, helping wealthy clients channel up to $2 million of after-tax contributions combined, often from other wealth vehicles. That was thanks to the '$1 million transitional non-concessional cap' which operated between 10 May 2006 and 30 June 2007, and the promise ofa retirement free of both income tax and capital gains tax once in SMSF pension phase past the age of 60.\" Chemay has no criticism for his wealthy former clients for taking advantage of this opportunity to lower the tax bill on their investment earnings, saying \"no one should feel compelled to pay one more dollar in tax than they are legally required to\". However, despite some tweaks since to try and limit super tax concessions, Chemay argues the system remains grossly inequitable and fiscally unsustainable given persistent federal budget deficits. \"At present,the top 20% of income earners receive over 55% of the total benefits from earnings tax concessions, with 39% going to the top 10% alone,\" he observes. \"From a sustainability perspective however, these tax concessions now have a life of their own and will by the mid-2040s cost taxpayers more than the Age Pension, according to Treasury's latest Intergenerational Report, and the chart from it below. \"It is estimated that between now and 2062-63,the cost of the Age Pension will reduce from 2.3% to 2% of GDP. Super tax concessions will by then be 2.4%, driven primarily by earnings tax concessions rising from 1% to 1.5% of GDP. \"That would be ironic indeed, with the system implemented to contain the burgeoning expenditure of the Age Pension costing taxpayers more than the policy problem it set out to fix. \"Earnings tax concessions grow in line with overall system growth, and so the only way to throttle back this tax leakage is to target high balance members, as the Div 296 proposal seeks to do.\" By Stephanie Chalmers A leading tax expert has warned that if the federal government cannot get its proposed changes to tax on superannuation accounts with balances over $3 million into law, it will destroy any chances of bigger tax reform. \"If Labor falters in getting this proposal through, then we have no chance for future further tax reform,\"Robert Breunig, a professor atAustralian National University, toldThe Business. \"For anybody who's kind of ambitious about tax reform, this is actually strategically important that this happens.\" While the vocal outrage over the changes is now reaching a peak, with daily coverage in some publications, the bill was first introduced to parliament in late 2023. It would impose an additional tax rate of 15 per cent on superannuation earnings from the portion of an individual's account balance over $3 million at the end of a financial year. That's in addition to the current 15 per cent tax on concessional super contributions. It has been proposed to come into effect from July 1 but is yet to pass into law. Professor Breunig, the director of the Tax and Transfer Policy Institute at ANU's Crawford School of Public Policy, said the current superannuation tax breaks were \"too generous\", largely at the top end of the scale. \"Super is taxed about right for the average person, but it's under-taxed for people with very large balances,\" he said. \"We've got people amassing now tens of millions of dollars in superannuation, which will generate millions of dollars of annual income for them. \"That's well beyond what we think is reasonably required for retirement.\" By Nassim Khadem Australia's consumer watchdog is believed to be investigating whether price gouging is going on at $34 billion ASX-listed REA Group, but the probe is still in its early stages and has not formally stated the real estate portal is ripping consumers off. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has instead said it's looking to ensure \"strong competition in the real estate market\". The consumer watchdog has been meeting agents and industry bodies over the past few weeks, asking whether they have feedback or issues with company. On Tuesday REA Group issueda statement to the ASX confirming that it had \"received a s155 Notice from the ACCC, requiring REA to provide information regarding certain subscription offerings\". The company noted 12.3 million visited realestate.com.au each month on average in the March quarter. \"REA is cooperating fully with the ACCC and is unable to comment further for confidentiality reasons,\" the company said. \"REA will continue to comply with its disclosure obligations and will update the market on this matter as appropriate.\" An ACCC spokeswoman said the consumer watchdog \"does not normally make comment on its ongoing investigations, noting that we conduct such work on a confidential basis\". \"Naturally, the ACCC is concerned to ensure there is strong competition in the important real estate sector.\" \"As the investigation is ongoing, the ACCC won't comment further at this time. The investigation is at an early stage, and we're yet to form a view.\" If you have more information about this story please contactNassim Khadematkhadem.nassim@abc.net.au ornassimkhadem@protonmail.com By Nadia Daly The price of Brent crude oil is higher thanks to worries about a reduction in Russian exports from possible new US sanctions on Russia. Though, as a note by Vivek Dhar from CBA states, this has been offset but the prospect of stronger OPEC+ supply. \"It is hard to be convinced that any new US sanctions on Russia will meaningfully dent Russia\u2019s oil exports. However, we think there is a stronger likelihood that OPEC+ announce another super sized supply hike in July later this week.\" \"We think OPEC+ are looking to quickly increase market share to keep WTI between $US55 60/bbl (and therefore Brent between $US60 65/bbl). At these price levels, the economics to expand US shale oil production are weakened considerably, thereby severely limiting future non OPEC+ supply growth. With subdued oil demand growth expected for the remainder of this decade, anaemic non OPEC+ supply growth means OPEC+ has a stronger likelihood of holding on to its market share. We seeBrent oil futuresaveraging$US65/bbl for the remainder of 2025 with downside risks of $US60/bbl tied to higher oil exports from Iran and OPEC+ being too aggressive in adding back supply.\" At 12:05pm AEST, Brent crude was worth $US65.69 a barrel.",

        "raw_text": "A US trade court has blocked President Donald Trump from using emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs on imports. The ruling on Wednesday, local time, by a three-judge panel at the New York-based Court of International Trade followed several lawsuits arguing that the president exceeded his authority, left US trade policy subject to his whims, and unleashed economic chaos. \"The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs,\" the court wrote, referring to the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Stephen Miller, posted the news on social media, writing \"the judicial coup is out of control\". In a statement, the White House said it is \"not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency\". The ruling faces certain appeal \u2014 and the Supreme Court will almost certainly be called upon to lend a final answer \u2014 but it casts a sharp blow on Mr Trump's policy. At least seven lawsuits are challenging the levies, the centrepiece of Mr Trump's trade policy. Tariffs must typically be approved by Congress, but Mr Trump says he has the power to act because the country's trade deficits amount to a national emergency. The plaintiffs argued that the emergency powers law does not authorise the use of tariffs, and even if it did, the trade deficit does not meet the law's requirement that an emergency be triggered only by an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\". The US has run a trade deficit with the rest of the world for 49 consecutive years. Global allies were plunged into uncertainty after Donald Trump announced the tariffs.(Reuters: Francis Mascarenhas) Mr Trump imposed tariffs on most of the countries in the world in an effort to reverse America's massive and longstanding trade deficits. He earlier plastered levies on imports from Canada, China and Mexico to combat the illegal flow of immigrants and synthetic opioids across the US border. His administration argues that courts approved then-president Richard Nixon's emergency use of tariffs in 1971, and that only Congress, and not the courts, can determine the \"political\" question of whether the president's rationale for declaring an emergency complies with the law. Mr Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs shook global financial markets and led many economists to downgrade the outlook for US economic growth. Manufacturers in China race to fulfil US orders as the reciprocal tariff pause takes effect, but the renewed trade war has already caused some businesses to take drastic measures. So far, though, the tariffs appear to have had little impact on the world's largest economy. The lawsuit was filed by a group of small businesses, including a wine importer, V.O.S. Selections, whose owner said the tariffs are having a major impact and his company may not survive. A dozen states also filed suit, led by Oregon. \"This ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can't be made on the president's whim,\" Attorney-General Dan Rayfield said. AP",

Professor Breunig, the director of the Tax and Transfer Policy Institute at ANU's Crawford School of Public Policy, said the current superannuation tax breaks are \"too generous\", largely at the top end of the scale. Labor needs to rethink how it goes about selling an idea as it confronts some really big challenges for the new parliament. \"Super is taxed about right for the average person, but it's under-taxed for people with very large balances,\" he said. \"Superannuation was designed for providing a retirement income for people so that people could have a comfortable retirement,\" Professor Breunig said, noting that the level of income will look different for different people, but could be in the realm of $100,000 or $200,000, or around 80 per cent of what someone was earning while they were working. \"We've got people amassing now tens of millions of dollars in superannuation, which will generate millions of dollars of annual income for them. \"That's well beyond what we think is reasonably required for retirement.\" Robert Breunig says all tax reform creates winners and losers.(ABC News: John Gunn) While the criticism of Labor's policy has been loud in recent weeks,Treasury has said it will only initially affect less than 0.5 per cent of Australians with a super account, or about 80,000 individuals. \"Whenever you do tax reform, you create winners and losers. \"Even if the winners are a large group of people and the losers are a small group of people, the loser's often very squeaky,\" Professor Breunig told The Business, describing the debate around the super reform as \"very vociferous\". Australia's super tax concessions will cost the government almost $60 billion in 2025-26, which is $9 billion more than expected. How can we afford it? One of the arguments raised by opponents of the super tax changes has been the lack of indexation, meaning it will capture a increasing portion of the population as super balances climb with inflation over time. However, the Grattan Institute's program director of housing and economic security, Brendan Coates, has described the idea it will disproportionately affect younger generations as \"simply nonsense\". \"Rather than being the biggest losers from the lack of indexation, younger Australians are the biggest beneficiaries,\"Dr Coates wrote in The Conversation. \"It means more older, wealthier Australians will shoulder some of the burden of budget repair and an ageing population. Otherwise, younger generations would bear this burden alone \u2026 Professor Breunig argued much more significant tax reform is needed to address intergenerational inequality in Australia. The federal government should intervene to help retirees spend their superannuation and avoid the savings system ending up as \"a massive inheritance scheme\", the Grattan Institute warns. For example, a switch from stamp duty charged on transfers of homes to a land tax, which would tax the growth in the value of property without discouraging the buying and selling of homes. \"I think the other thing we really need to look at is that our system treats very wealthy older individuals as if they are very poor. \"We give the age pension to people who have millions of dollars of assets. We treat them as if have no income. We provide age care to people without asking them to contribute to it. \"I do think we need to look at putting all of people's assets, including the family home, into the age pension means test and into the means test for age care,\" Professor Breunig said. \"Now, those will not be very popular policies, but they are really the policies that we need to address intergenerational inequity.\" He described the super changes as a \"really important first step\" to opening the door to broader reform. One of the other aspects of the policy seized upon by its critics is the fact that it will tax unrealised capital gains \u2014 that is, it will levy an annual tax of the increased paper value of an asset \u2014 for example, property held in a self-managed super fund that is yet to be sold, so the increase in value is yet to be \"realised\". On the failed campaign trail, ousted opposition leader Peter Dutton described the move as a \"quasi-inheritance tax\", while farming groups have said it could create cashflow issues for farmers holding properties in their super funds. Our superannuation funds have to find $3.2 billion worth of things to invest in, every week. Is that pool of money a risk to our financial stability? Professor Breunig said people were currently putting assets like farms and properties into super funds as a tax shelter. \"[Superannuation] wasn't set up to be a business vehicle where you have multiple property holdings or farms, or even actual businesses run through them, and the only reason people are doing that is to avoid tax.\" He said only taxing actual gains has encouraged people to hold onto assets, giving the example of someone holding multiple properties in an SMSF. He argued a fair approach would be to allow people to opt in to either paying the tax on unrealised gains annually, or accumulate the tax bill until the assets are sold. \"That's very much what we do with council rates. If you're a pensioner, you don't have a lot of liquid assets and you get your rates bill, you call the council and you say, 'look, I don't have any money to pay this,' [and] they say, 'That's fine. We'll just keep track of what you owe us. We'll index it by inflation and when your house is transferred or sold, we'll then take the tax liability that you owe.' \"So, we could give that to everybody in the system \u2014 we could say, 'We're going to tax the unrealised gains. You can pay it now, or we'll keep track of it, and we'll charge you when the property is either transferred or sold.'\" The Grattan Institute's Dr Coates noted that one-fifth of all withdrawals from super were currently via bequests and Treasury expects that to grow to one-third of all withdrawals by 2060. \"Superannuation in Australia was intended to help fund retirements. Instead, it has become a taxpayer-subsidised inheritance scheme,\" he wrote. A report from the think tank, released in January, found many retirees are net savers,with their super balances growing for decades after they retire, for fear of outliving their savings. Grattan's modelling showed that Australians who draw down their super at the minimum rate when they retire will leave the equivalent of 65 per cent of their original super balance unspent by the age of 92.",

        "raw_text": "When all the hype and the fury is stripped away, the decision to extend the life of the gigantic North West Shelf gas plant boils down to one thing. \"It's really all about Browse,\" says RISC Advisory boss Martin Wilkes in relation to the huge gas field off the Kimberley coast of Western Australia. Browse is one of the country's biggest untapped resources projects, with gas reserves large enough to meet the equivalent of Australia's entire domestic demand for almost 20 years. To the Western Australian government and the state's industry, it represents energy security, jobs and billions of dollars of investment. And for some of the world's biggest oil and gas companies \u2014 not to mention Australia's flag-bearer, Woodside \u2014 Browse presents as the last great hurrah for the country's gas export industry. But the problem is Browse is a long way from anywhere. It's also full of carbon. What's more, it has no shortage of detractors. For those reasons, it has always remained an elusive development for its backers since being discovered more than half a century ago. The North West Shelf is therefore the only viable pathway to development Browse has left, according to those in the industry who have followed the project for decades. \"They want to bring Browse back to the North West Shelf, which has been on the cards for a pretty long time, really,\" Mr Wilkes explains. \"And that development has nowhere to go unless they got an extension of the North West Shelf. \"It's a big gas field, but it's in the middle of nowhere. \"That's why it hasn't been developed \u2014 it's hard.\" Protesters are calling the approval a \"lightening rod\" for anger.(ABC News: Keane Bourke) By provisionallyextending the licence for the North West Shelf to operate another 40 years to 2070, Canberra has thrown Browse a lifeline. But in doing so, it has also set itself on a collision course. That's because Browse is likely to be the mother-of-all environmental fights \u2014 a pivotal clash between those seeking an end to new fossil fuel mega-project and those in the opposite corner. Alex Hillman from the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) says the resistance to any bid to develop Browse will be fierce. \"It's insane,\" Mr Hillman says of the decision announced on Wednesday. \"This will get people marching on the streets. Climate groups have labelled Browse a \"carbon bomb\", claiming the project could lead to emissions of up to 1.6 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent over its lifetime \u2014 an amount three times Australia's annual pollution output. Even if Woodside can capture carbon, it will still only have a tiny impact on the total facility's lifetime emissions.(ABC News: Keane Bourke) In anticipation of this charge, Woodside and its project partners in Browse have pivoted in recent times to say they'll try to capture and bury much of the carbon contained in the Browse gas fields. Indeed, the carbon content of Browse is in its own right significant. Carbon dioxide accounts for as much as 12 per cent of the fields' reserves \u2014 far higher than most projects and utterly dwarfing Woodside's Scarborough development, which has a carbon content of less than 1 per cent. Amid the spinifex on a remote WA island looms Chevron's troubled carbon capture facility. The role the technology might play in cutting greenhouse gas emissions is likely to get a fresh airing at global climate talks in Azerbaijan. Mr Hillman says there are big question marks still hanging over the effectiveness and viability of carbon capture and storage technologies. He points to the well-documented challenges at the Gorgon LNG project off the Pilbara coast, where US behemoth Chevron has struggled to make the technology work. Even if Woodside could do a better job, he says it would barely make a difference, noting the lion's share of emissions from gas projects come from the burning of the fuel \u2014 not the release of carbon from the fields. And on this score \u2014 the measure of so-called scope 3 emissions \u2014 he says the Browse partners aren't proposing to do much of anything at all. \"The vast bulk of emissions is still in the scope three for customers,\" Mr Hillman says. \"If Woodside manages to implement carbon capture and storage and it manages to do it successfully \u2026 it's still only a tiny impact on the total facility's lifetime emissions.\" Others take a different view. An image showing how the Browse project will work.(Supplied: Woodside) Steve Lewis is an industry veteran whose consultancy, BrightSource, helps gas users such as mines buy the fuel. Mr Lewis says to understand the enduring appeal of Browse it's first necessary to get a handle on the composition of WA's economy. He notes that gas is still the main fuel used for so much of the state's industrial base, from mineral processing to mining. And much more than other states, he says the west is still heavily dependent on gas to generate electricity \u2014 a dependency that's only likely to grow deeper amid efforts to get out of state-owned coal by the end of the decade. While gas accounts for only a tiny share of the electricity mix on the eastern seaboard, he says in WA its more like a third. Such is WA's need for gas, he notes the state uses more of the fuel in its own economy than all of the eastern states combined despite having a much smaller population. Woodside intends to build two floating production storage and offloading facilities, which look like big ships, for the Browse Project.(Supplied: Woodside) \"Western Australia has a long history of gas usage going back to the 80s,\" Mr Lewis says. \"It's very significant for the state.\" According to Mr Lewis, the North West Shelf itself marked the beginning of WA's modern gas industry and, more broadly, Australia's presence as an LNG superpower. But he notes the fields which have underpinned the North West Shelf and its colossal importance \u2014 the facility once accounted for 1 per cent of Australia's economy \u2014 are in terminal decline. To that end, Mr Lewis says the decision to extend the life of the gas plant is aimed at solving two problems \u2014 keeping a huge, valuable asset alive for longer and enabling the development of another one. By piping Browse gas 900 kilometres south and processing it through the North West Shelf, he says Woodside et al would avoid the need for a new LNG plant that would come at huge cost. Secondly, and by extension, they would also pay less in processing \u2014 or \"tolling\" \u2014 fees to the Shelf than they would in depreciation at a vastly expensive new LNG plant. Woodside's Karratha Gas Plant would process gas from the Browse Basin.(Supplied: Woodside) After all, he says, the costs of building the North West Shelf have already been recovered by its owners. \"It's all about encouraging more gas supply into the state by using existing infrastructure,\" he says. \"And that's an economically efficient way to develop gas fields and gas projects \u2014 to use existing infrastructure to toll new gas to ensure there's enough gas for the state going forward.\" In the absence of Browse, Mr Lewis reckons WA is headed for structural shortages in gas that could have painful consequences for the state's economy. Aluminium refineries that are WA's biggest users of gas could struggle to survive, he warns, shortfalls would lead to sky-high prices that would also make it harder to build gas-fired generators needed to help replace retiring coal plants. Perversely, Mr Lewis says a raft of new critical minerals processing plants required for the energy transition could also be hit \u2014 or left on the drawing board. On Western Australia's Burrup Peninsula, sacred Aboriginal rock art sits near a major gas plant and other chemical plants.(ABC News: Charlie McLean) \"It becomes pretty challenging,\" Mr Lewis says, if Browse is never developed. \"The market operator forecast is there won't be sufficient supply from around 2028, 2029 onwards unless significant new amounts of gas come into the market. \"And that's really just a function of existing fields in decline.\" For Mr Wilkes and Mr Lewis, an extension of the North West Shelf's operating licence is one thing, but access to enough gas to keep its giant refrigerators turning natural gas into LNG is another. There are already indications about what might happen in the event of a failure on that front. The Greens, the Australian Conservation Federation and traditional owners are among those expressing their opposition to Woodside's North West Shelf expansion approval. Last year, Woodside shut one of these refrigerators \u2014 or trains as they are known in the industry \u2014 that had been part of the original development more than 40 years ago. \"There are several implications, aren't there,\" says Mr Wilkes when asked about what would happen if insufficient amounts of gas are found to replace depleting supplies at the North West Shelf. \"One is that facility gets dismantled and abandoned earlier than it would have done otherwise. \"Another is the gas never gets to market, never gets produced.\" For Mr Hillman from the ACCR, that would be best outcome. He reckons the dogged pursuit of Browse by its corporate and political backers flies in the face of commercial common sense, saying the project comes with huge risks and may never be profitable. Bowse's plans could fly in the face of plans to wipe out Australia's greenhouse gas emissions.(Supplied: Australian Institute of Marine Science) Worse still, he argues, Browse would make a mockery of Australia's ambitions to stamp out greenhouse gas emissions and decarbonise by the middle of the century. \"This just enables Woodside to continue making bad decisions with investor funds,\" Mr Hillman says. \"It enables Woodside to chase this dream of investing in this project which it's been trying and failing to do for years. \"We don't think Browse stacks up financially, but that doesn't mean the project won't happen.",

        "summary": "Tech billionaire Elon Musk has left his role spearheading the Trump administration's efforts to downsize the US government. His announcement came a day after he criticised the US president's signature tax policy, warning it would increase the US deficit and was undermining his work at the Department of Government Efficiency.",
        "raw_text": "Elon Musk is leaving his role as a top adviser to Donald Trump a day after criticising the US president's controversial tax bill for increasing government debt by up to $US3 trillion ($4.67 trillion). Mr Musk previously headed up the Trump administration's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which aimed to slash trillions of US dollars in government spending, before announcing his departure last month. But in an interview with US broadcaster CBS, the owner of tech giants SpaceX and Telsa said Mr Trump's large tax bill, officially known as the \"One Big, Beautiful Bill Act\", contradicted DOGE's aims of reducing the federal deficit. \"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Mr Musk said. The tech billionaire had been one of the Trump administration's highest-profile supporters.(Reuters: Kevin Lamarque) The US president has repeatedly said the \"big beautiful bill\" will usher in a new \"golden age\" for the US. But following Mr Musk's remarks, Mr Trump told reporters he also held concerns about some aspects of the bill. \"We will be negotiating that bill, and I'm not happy about certain aspects of it, but I'm thrilled by other aspects of it,\" he said. The bill, which now sits before the US Senate after passing the House of Representatives, aims to shrink social safety net programs to pay for a 10-year extension of deep tax cuts for wealthier taxpayers. The spending bill is the centrepiece of Mr Trump's domestic policy agenda and could define his second term in the White House. Independent analysts have warned it could increase the deficit by as much as $US4 trillion over a decade. Mr Musk's comments came a day before he announced his departure from DOGE on his social media site, X. Saying his \"scheduled time as a Special Government Employee\" was coming to an end, he thanked Mr Trump while making no mention of the spending bill. A White House official, who requested anonymity to talk about the change, confirmed that Mr Musk was leaving. He had previously announced he would be stepping back from his government work and rededicating himself to companies like the electric automaker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX. He has also said he would reduce his political spending because \"I think I've done enough\". In a separate interview with The Washington Post, Mr Musk said that the \"federal bureaucracy situation\" he had tried to combat with DOGE was \"much worse than I realised\". It is a threat to Australian borrowers on fixed-interest mortgages, and a concern for anyone with exposure to US assets, including through superannuation. \"I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in [Washington] DC, to say the least.\" Mr Musk had previously been positive about the opportunity to reshape Washington. He wore campaign hats in the White House, held campaign rallies and talked about excessive spending as an existential crisis. He was also gushing in his praise of the US president and even sold him a Tesla on the front lawn of the White House. \"The more I've gotten to know President Trump, the more I like the guy,\" Mr Musk said at one point. \"Frankly, I love him.\" Mr Trump repaid the favour, describing Mr Musk as \"a truly great American\". It is unclear what, if any, impact Mr Musk's comments about the bill will have on the legislative debate. But Mr Trump remains the dominant figure within the Republican Party, and many Republican politicians have been unwilling to cross the president when he applies pressure for his agenda. The Congressional Budget Office, in a preliminary estimate, said the tax provisions would increase federal deficits by $US3.8 trillion over the decade. Donald Trump says the \"big beautiful bill\" will lead to an American \"golden age\".(AP: Manuel Balce Ceneta) Changes to federal health programs, food stamps and other services would reduce spending by more than $US1 trillion over the same period. House Republican leaders say increased economic growth would allow the bill to be deficit-neutral or reducing, but outside watchdogs are sceptical. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the bill would add $US3 trillion to the debt, including interest, over the next decade. The bill passed the US lower house by one vote, and some Republican US senators now tasked with considering it have expressed concerns about the winding back of benefit programs. AFP/AP/Reuters",

        "raw_text": "Energy efficient houses are a \"must-have\" for a growing number of buyers, commanding a premium price in markets across the country, property experts say. The demand is reflected in real estate advertising with half the homes currently for sale touting some sort of energy efficient feature, according to a new report from the property website Domain. North-facing homes, double-glazed windows and solar panels are all attractive features that offer year-round comfort as well as smaller energy bills, the report says. Domain's chief of research Nicola Powell said much of that demand is being pushed by \"middle Australia\", especially withenergy prices set to rise for half a million homes and businesses across from July. \"It does appear that middle Australia is really driving the uptake and driving the price premiums for a more energy efficient home,\" Dr Powell said. Energy efficient homes are getting more and more attention from buyers, the report says.(ABC News: Michael Lloyd) At a house inspection in Brisbane's south, real estate agent James Austin said buyers had been asking about energy efficiency more and more, particularly for new builds. He said solar panels, solar hot water and energy efficient lighting were commonly asked about. \"I know the price of housing is very high, but maybe if you spend a bit more at the start you can save in the long run if the house is energy efficient,\" he said. Real estate agent James Austin says he is often asked about energy efficiency.(ABC News: Tobi Loftus) In Brisbane energy efficient homes on the market are attracting almost 20 per cent more views online, according to the report. Dr Powell said for prospective buyers anything that could reduce costs in the long-term was becoming more of a priority. Nicola Powell says cost of living and house prices mean people are looking to save where they can.(Supplied) In Queensland suburbs, including Calamvale in Brisbane's south and Robina on the Gold Coast, houses are selling for up to $300,000 more than non-efficient homes, according to the report. It said energy efficient units sold for almost 10 per cent more than non-efficient units. North-facing homes \u2014 which provide passive heating in winter and reduced cooling needs in summer \u2014 boost the price of a house by $375,000 on average across the country, the report said. Solar remains the most popular way to save on energy, the report says.(ABC News: Jess Davis) Solar panels continue to be the most popular energy efficient feature, but don't add as much value. Other features such as roof and ceiling insulation can cut heating and cooling needs by up to 45 per cent. Homes chew up about a quarter of the country's electricity, with disproportionate share taken by homes with \"poor thermal performance\", that overheat in summer and lose warmth in winter. CoreLogic data shows homes built pre-2010 have a median 2.8-star energy rating, while those built post-2010 have a median 5.9 rating. Dr Powell said the challenge of retrofitting Australia's existing housing stock \u2014 70 per cent of which was built before 2003 \u2014 is also an opportunity for policymakers. \"If you're thinking about putting in double-glazing or solar panels, it does come at a hefty cost. Having the right policies in place to drive that uptake and ensuring our older housing stock are just as efficient will be a step in the right direction,\" she said. Experts warn renters and low-income households risk being left behind unless more incentives to bring older homes up to modern standards are brought in. Green Building Council of Australia chief executive Davina Rooney said it's important that renters are included. Half of real estate ads commenton the house's energy efficiency according to the report.(ABC News: Michael Lloyd) She urged for more schemes like the Queenslandplan to offer grants to landlords for solar panels. \"We need to make these things more common and drive them across every part of the market,\" Ms Rooney said. In the ACT all residential property sales and rental advertisements are required to disclose their energy efficiency rating. Expanding that scheme nationwide would be a step in the right direction, Dr Powell said. \"That really drives transparency and allows a renter to actually see the potential energy efficiency of that home and therefore the potential running costs.\"",

        "raw_text": "Climate advocates have been left devastated by the federal government's decision to sign off on an extension of Australia's largest oil and gas project until 2070, describing it as a \"dark day\". Newly minted Environment Minister Murray Watt on Wednesday approved Woodside's proposal to extend the life of its North West Shelf gas project, after it sat on ice for six years. Federal environment minister Murray Watt has approved the decision to extend Woodside's North West Shelf project.(ABC News: Keane Bourke) Approval was granted under strict conditions, which the gas giant has 10 days to review and accept. A swathe of scientists have raised concerns about the project, including the impact of emissions on the environment and ancient Aboriginal rock art at the nearby Murujuga Cultural Landscape. Australian Conservation Foundation campaigner Piper Rollins said there were no conditions that could be imposed to address those concerns. \"We know that this approval is going to be responsible for billions of tonnes of carbon emissions emitted into our atmosphere,\" she said. Ms Rollins is concerned about the climate change ramifications.(ABC News: Courtney Withers) \"This state is going to suffer the most and this project is going to disproportionately drive climate change and make it even worse.\" Senator Watt's announcement came just hours aftera bid to have the petroglyphs at Murujuga added to the World Heritage list stalledover concerns about the effect emissions were having on the priceless rock art. The UN recommended the government inform it of the intention to authorise major projects which may affect the \"outstanding universal value\" of the Murujuga site. The Environment Minister Murray Watt has given Woodside the green light to extend the life of the Karratha Gas Plant.(ABC News: Charlie Mclean) Anda leading scientist expressed \"grave concern\"about \"unacceptable interference\" in a study of the potential impacts of emissions on the rock carvings. Greens Upper House MP Sophie McNeill said the timing of Senator Watt's announcement was concerning. \"The UN World Heritage listing of Murujuga's rock art is under threat from Woodside industrial emissions. That's the breaking news that came out from UNESCO just this morning, and what we've seen is federal Labor rush to get this decision out before the news about UNESCO does the rounds,\" she said. Greens MP Sophie McNeill says the decision left her 'speechless'.(ABC News: Courtney Withers) \"This is a devastating, dark day and I know there will be many parents like myself tonight having to tell my kids what happened today. \"We're just so devastated by this news, we're kind of speechless.\" Mardathoonera woman Raelene Cooper, a former chair of the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation, expressed her intention to continue fight the decision, after shelaunched a last-minute legal bid last week to stop it in the Federal Court. Her court application had argued Woodside's industrial developments on the Burrup Peninsula pose a threat to thousands of Aboriginal petroglyphs. \"See you in court,\" she said in a statement on Wednesday. \"I'm not on my own, I'm bringing warriors from this ngurra [home] with me.\" Ms Cooper opposes the approval.(ABC News: Keane Bourke) Ngarluma Yindjibarndi woman Kaylene Daniel said the decision \"saddened\" her. \"Because all through those years that me, my family and others out there have talked about this place, protected this place Murujuga,\" she said. \"Murujuga meant so much to us.\" Kaylene Daniel campaigned against an extension to the North West Shelf gas project on the Burrup Peninsula, and said she wouldn't give up the fight.(ABC News: Charlie Mclean) Ms Daniel described Murujuga as \"like a library\" full of First Nations stories, songlines and rock art and said she would not give up fighting to protect her country. \"I can't give up, it's not for me to give up, my family didn't give up,\" she said. \"I'm still going to speak out for this country, because this country is important, it's sacred and it's been passed on to me. A crowd of protesters gathered outside Woodside Energy's annual general meeting in Perth earlier this month.(ABC News: Keane Bourke) Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility analyst Alex Hillman worked as Woodside's climate change advisor for five years. He said there were merits to using gas as a transitional fossil fuel on the path to greater renewable use, but said the world already had enough of it for this purpose. \"We don't need any more gas to be developed,\" he said. Mr Hillman also questioned if the project was in the best interests of Woodside shareholders. \"We don't see a compelling business case for Woodside to invest in any of the gas that would feed North West Shelf,\" he said. Woodside chief executive Meg O'Neill said the gas giant was currently reviewing the conditions of the approval. \"The conditions relate to heritage and air quality, so our team is working through with the department to understand what the conditions mean, and we will respond and work with the department in coming days,\" she said. Addressing concerns around potential emissions damage to cultural heritage sites, Ms O'Neill said Woodside believed \"industry and heritage can coexist\". Ms O'Neill says Woodside was working closely with the government to understand the impact of its emissions.(ABC News: Elizabeth Pickering) \"We've worked very closely with the government over many years to understand what sort of emissions might cause an impact,\" she said. Dampier publican Nick Bond said the decision brought \"a sense of relief and optimism\". \"It's going to give security and financial backing to the country for a long, long time to come,\" he said. Mr Bond feels common sense has prevailed.(ABC News: Charlie Mclean) \"It gives us the security we need to be able to invest in new accommodation, new infrastructure and make our asset better for the community. \"The whole country's going to benefit from this decision.\" Karratha local Elise Murray took a different view. \"I've lived there, I've grown up there, it's a beautiful place to be,\" the 18-year-old said. \"To put it at risk by focusing on the money that it will bring in \u2014 obviously it's amazing that it'll build so many jobs for local people, but if you're ruining the environment in the first place, you're not going to have enough people that want to live there by the end of it.\" \"It's really important that we look after the area and focus on a more renewable energy source.\"",

The Australian Bureau of Statistics' latest data shows home construction was valued at$24.275 billion in the March quarter\u2014 up 7 per cent on the same time last year. But the value of all construction work done in the March quarter was flat in seasonally adjusted terms. The value of building work rose 0.9 per cent, to $39 billion, while engineering was down 1 per cent, to $35.36 billion. Residential building bucked the trend, according to the bureau. \"[Spending] increased 1.6 per cent in the March quarter and is 7 per cent higher than at the same time last year. Non-residential building work fell 0.1 per cent in the March quarter and is 3.9 per cent lower than at the same time last year,\" the ABS said. \"The trend estimate for total building work done rose 0.5 per cent in the March quarter.\" One of Australia's leading business lobby groups warned the recent spike was not enough to meet the federal government's housing targets. The government's National Housing Accord's target is to deliver 1.2 million new homes by mid-2029. The goalwas set in 2023after an agreement between industry, the Commonwealth and the states and territories. \"Australia is building a lot more, but not enough is in housing \u2026 to achieve the National Housing Accord goals, an immediate 40 per cent uplift in dwelling completion rates is required,\" said Innes Willox, chief executive of the Australian Industry Group. Innes Willox, who runs employer body the Ai Group, said the problems facing the home building sector were surging costs, chronic skilled labour shortages and declining productivity.(ABC News: John Gunn) Dr Michael Fotheringham, from the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, said the key element of the national accord was also to build well-located homes. \"So, thinking about where we're building is really important \u2026 There are different schools of thought as to what well-located should mean,\" he said. \"Should we continue to build on the outer edges of our major cities, or should we be thinking more about increasing the density of our cities? \"We also need to not sacrifice quality for the sake of throwing together as many as possible, as quickly as possible, and creating a bigger problem down the track.\" Dr Michael Fotheringham highlighted thefederal government's national urban policythat was released last year, which explored the challenges facing Australia's largest cities. \"What's shifted now [since the election] is that, actually, [receiving] remarkably little coverage, the minister for housing, Claire O'Neill, is now also the minister for cities,\" he said. Dr Michael Fotheringham said there was a growing recognition by the government that they needed to take a more active role in housing and planning.(ABC News: Patrick Rocca) The additional portfolio for Ms O'Neill was an important unification of two closely related policy areas, Dr Fotheringham said, because it meant the federal government was thinking about planning and housing delivery. \"There are machinery of government changes currently afoot to support that realignment,\" he said.",

On top of making a $15 million investment, Himadri has licensed Sicona's fast-charging lithium-battery technology and will build its own manufacturing facility in India.",
        "raw_text": "A breakthrough Australian technology that promises 40 per cent faster charging times for lithium batteries has attracted interest from overseas. Wollongong startup Sicona has licensed the rights to its technology, SiCx, to Indian chemicals company Himadri. The product is a silicon carbon anode that is added to lithium-ion batteries to improve efficiency. As part of the deal, Himadri will make a $15 million investment in the Wollongong business and will have the right to create its own facility producing the product in India. \"The revenue that it will generate for us in terms of royalties is in the tens of millions of dollars that will flow over quite a long period.\" Christiaan Jordaan says he intends to employ more people in Wollongong following the deal.(Supplied: Sicona) In the initial stages, Himadri's investment will allow the Wollongong company to expand its laboratory operations in the Illawarra and employ more staff. In the long term, Himadri's plan to build its own manufacturing facility producing Sicona's product will form the blueprint for the Australian company establishing its own facility elsewhere, most likely in the US. Previously, Mr Jordaan hasspoken out about the difficulty in setting up manufacturing facilities in Australia, forcing home-grown ideas into development overseas. \"The Australian\u00a0government needs to incentivise local manufacturing, as other governments like the US [have] ... there is a lot of protectionist trade policy being implemented.\" Mr Jordaan said not having to build a large, first-of-its-kind manufacturing facility would allow Sicona to learn from Himadri's experience. While Sicona's operations are based in Wollongong, the company intends to expand globally.(Supplied: Sicona) \"This is a very neat way to overcome that challenge for us to get our first commercial-scale operation \u2026 our vision is to become the largest producer of these materials globally. \"Over time, that means we want to build and operate ourselves and while we have that intention in the US already, we're looking at other opportunities \u2026 to build globally.\" Sicona previously proposed a commercial-scale lithium-ion battery factory in the Illawarra suburb of Shellharbour. The technology has been developed at several sites in Wollongong.(Supplied: Sicona) Lithium-ion batteries have many uses, but they all have a cathode positive side and an anode negative side. The cathode side has materials like nickel, cobalt and manganese, while the anode is predominantly graphite. When Sicona's product was mixed in with an anode's graphite, Mr Jordaan said the impact was significant. \"It boosts the storage capacity of the battery overall,\" he said. Lithium ion batteries are found in many household items, as well as electric cars.(ABC News: Lucas Hill) There are a number of sectors driving the need for better-quality lithium-ion batteries. Examples include artificial intelligence in personal devices that use batteries, militaries using autonomous drones, the development of humanoid robots and electric vehicles. \"What I've observed in China most recently is almost every new vehicle that you find on the road is electric,\" Mr Jordaan said. \"Artificial intelligence is driving higher power requirements for other devices, including mobile phones, laptops and robots. \"All of that requires denser and better batteries \u2026 and is driving huge demand for our product and our technology.\"",

        "raw_text": "Interim Matildas coach Tom Sermanni has delivered a scathing criticism of theA-League Womencompetition\u2019s professionalism and says Australian football remains \u201cgrossly underinvested\u201d in the women\u2019s game. That the league is not yet fully professional is particularly \u201cirritating\u201d for Sermanni, given the blockbuster success of the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup. Every player in theMatildassquad has played in the ALW at some point, including six players currently in the domestic league. Speaking ahead ofFriday\u2019s international friendly against Argentina, Sermanni, typically a happy-go-lucky character, unleashed both barrels. \u201cWe really need to have, at A-League level, a real rethink,\u201d he said. \u201cThe league has been going for 17 years. When we started the league, and the coaches came from our institute programs, we had full-time coaches and more full-time staff than we have now, 17 years in. \u201cThe A-League separated five years ago and what we have done since then is we\u2019ve got home and away, which is an improvement, but we are still grossly underinvested in the women\u2019s game here. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a thought process going forward about where they want to take the league or what they want to do. But there\u2019s a huge amount of work that actually needs to be done. \u201cIt\u2019s even more irritating, when you think how we had the most successful World Cup ever two years ago, and A-League Women are in the situation that they\u2019re in now, it\u2019s just not good enough.\u201d The ALW, formerly W-League, started in 2008. \u201cAt that time, our league was the forefront of women\u2019s leagues, to be perfectly honest,\u201d Sermanni said. \u201cIt\u2019s still very important, and coaches, staffs and players are doing exceptionally well. But the league itself is in need of significant improvement in its professionalism. \u201cThere are three clubs that are suitably staffed \u2013 that\u2019s Melbourne City, Melbourne Victory and Wellington Phoenix. And the rest of the clubs are completely inadequately staffed. Players get 35-week contracts now. \u201cA league has just started in Canada \u2013 football wise, we\u2019re well in advance of Canada \u2013 where the base salary is twice what our basic salary is, where there\u2019s full-time staff, full-time players. \u201cAnd we are still trying to produce players when we have a space of three months where the club has got no contact, no control, no reference point for the players, to actually keep them and know what\u2019s happening.\u201d Sign up toMoving the Goalposts No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women\u2019s football after newsletter promotion Professional Footballers Australia has warned of the potential for a \u201cplayer drain\u201d from the ALW and its effect on developing Matildas if the league isn\u2019t fully professionalised. The PFA\u2019s chief executive, Beau Busch, reiterated professionalisation needed to happen by the 2026-27 season to capitalise on next year\u2019s Asian Cup. \u201cSetting that as our target and achieving it will prevent us falling further behind as global standards continue to rise at pace,\u201d he said. The Australian Professional Leagues have been contacted for comment. In Canada\u2019s Northern Super League, where new Matildas call-up Kahli Johnson plays, the minimum wage is A$56,000, more than double the ALW\u2019s $26,000, with a salary cap of A$1.8m compared to $600,000. Sermanni will coach the Matildas for the 150th time across three stints in Friday night\u2019s clash with Argentina at Marvel Stadium, with Central Coast\u2019s Emily Husband and Western United\u2019s Kat Smith among his assistants.

        "raw_text": "The Australian character in the famous London club\u2019s dressing room has been apparent all season, but fans\u2019 expectations in the league were not met. The month of May offered one final hope for success, a season-defining European cup final. And on a memorable day last week, a snatch-and-grab 1-0 win delivered silverware, the first time the club had won the competition in almost two decades. But this has nothing to do with Ange Postecoglou or Tottenham. The achievement of Steph Catley, Caitlin Foord, Kyra Cooney-Cross and their Arsenal teammates todefeat standard-bearers Barcelonain the final of the Women\u2019s Champions League on Sunday is monumental within the history of Australian football, and a much-needed boost for the Matildas. Only three Australians \u2013 Craig Johnston, Harry Kewell and Zeljko Kalac \u2013 have won the men\u2019s equivalent. The women\u2019s edition didn\u2019t even exist before the turn of the millennium, and the Arsenal trio join two-time winner Ellie Carpenter \u2013 victorious in 2020 and 2022 with Lyon \u2013 asMatildasto have raised the trophy. Matildas vice-captain Emily van Egmond, in camp in Melbourne ahead of the friendly against Argentina on Friday, said having four European champions in the current Australian national team is \u201cunbelievable\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge credit to them, they\u2019ve worked so hard and I\u2019m just really happy for the girls to be able to experience that,\u201d she said. \u201cNot a lot of people in their careers would even get to play Champions League, so to be able to come out and say that you\u2019re a winner is amazing.\u201d The 31-year-old has just completed her own season at Birmingham in England\u2019s second-tier, narrowly failing to win promotion. There she has watched Postecoglou, Australia\u2019s other European trophy winner, dominate UK headlines in a challenging but ultimately triumphant season culminating in last week\u2019s Europa League final. Van Egmond returned to Australia almost a week ago, just in time to see the local reaction to Postecoglou\u2019s achievement. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for him. To come out with a trophy in the end was unreal for him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just really nice to see an Aussie coach flying the flag over there in probably the biggest competition, in the Premier League.\u201d The interest in Postecoglou has been stratospheric, even though the Europa League is not the most prestigious men\u2019s European trophy. In some ways the achievement of the Matildas\u2019 trio for Arsenal against Barcelona \u2013 Champions League winners in three of the previous four seasons with a side bulging with Spain\u2019s 2023 World Cup winners \u2013 has been overlooked in comparison. But Van Egmond said the recognition was there, and women\u2019s football momentum continues to grow. \u201cI think they\u2019ve been getting decent coverage, maybe it isn\u2019t quite as big as what Ange has been getting,\u201d she said. \u201cNonetheless, I think the fact that now you had a sold out crowd there for the Champions League final [in Lisbon], which probably wouldn\u2019t have happened five years ago.\u201d As uncertainty hangs overthe A-Leaguesandat Football Australia, the performances of Postecoglou and the Arsenal group have flipped the country\u2019s football script.

A day later, there is a Melbourne derby in the A-League grand final, which is expected to go close to selling out. A new Matildas coach will be named next month to lead the side to the home Asian Cup in March. But on the field the Matildas, FA\u2019s commercial and cultural jewel, are a in a state of flux. Striker Sam Kerr is still injured, and will not take part in the current camp. Mary Fowler\u2019s own ACL injury has put her in doubt for the Asian Cup. Vice-captain Carpenter and midfielder Katrina Gorry have been given the game off for personal leave. Speculation suggests Lyon coach Joe Montemurro, the former manager of Arsenal, will take control of the side next month. But this week\u2019s focus will be on interim Tom Sermanni, who will oversee his 150th Matildas match, and the returning Arsenal heroes. The Gunners trio will be assessed by staff when they arrive in Australia in the coming days but with a second match in Canberra on Monday, there is a chance none will play on Friday. Whether they make it onto the pitch or not, Van Egmond said their presence will be felt. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve come off such a high, it\u2019s hard not to shy away from that,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there\u2019ll be a massive positive vibe around them and, honestly, the girls will just probably want to ask them a bunch of questions about how it all went.\u201d",

That roar was bigger than for Kalyn Ponga or Cameron Munster. Throatier than the one reserved for Patty Carrigan. And the face who inspired it hasn\u2019t seen a tackle in seven years.To say Billy Slater is well-loved by Queenslanders is an understatement. As if Romeo had only a passing interest in Juliet. Or, to a fresh batch of biscuits, the Cookie Monster wouldn\u2019t say no. Sign up toAustralia Sport Get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk after newsletter promotion There is good reason, too. Slater\u2019s playing career sparkles with highlights as much as honours. Millions followed his journey as humble roustabout from Nambour to the heights of rugby league, never losing his endearing identity as \u201cBilly The Kid\u201d. He proved himself to be a Maroons great, one of the symbols in Queensland\u2019s most successful Origin era.Since retiring in 2018, his legend has only grown. He has shown to be an adept analyst on broadcasts, often speaking in front of AAMI Park\u2019s Billy Slater Stand. His business as a thoroughbred breeder goes from strength to strength. His performance as a horse-riding TV comp\u00e8re at last year\u2019s Melbourne Cup carnival was the highlight of Channel Nine\u2019s coverage. And of course, as a rookie coach, he masterminded Queensland victories in his first two Origin series.In this context, the crowd\u2019s affection for him on Wednesday night is to be expected. But after New South Wales\u2019 largely one-sided victory in the State of Origin opener, it\u2019s clear love can only do so much. \u201cI feel pretty flat, to be honest, about our performance,\u201d he said after the 18-6 defeat.The result was hardly a thrashing, and for Slater there were positive signs. Winger Xavier Coates was a constant aerial threat and backrower Jeremiah Nanai was a willing combatant. Debutant Robert Toia was targeted by the Blues and forced into 24 tackles (the Maroons\u2019 other centre Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow made just seven) but the rookie missed just three and was tidy with the ball. \u201cI thought his debut was great, so he can hold his head up high,\u201d Slater said.But in truth, there is just as much cause for concern. The Blues went in as favourites, and were far from their best themselves. Five-eighth Mitch Moses, catalyst for the Blues\u2019 resurgence in last year\u2019s series, was mostly a bystander. Latrell Mitchell ran for just 58m, Liam Martin even less. Spencer Leniu played just 26 minutes.The Maroons coach believes the fans at Suncorp \u201cdidn\u2019t see the best of this Queensland team\u201d on Thursday. That \u201cit\u2019s definitely not a personnel thing\u201d. That he knows \u201cwhat this team\u2019s capable of\u201d. But it\u2019s becoming difficult to understand what he sees.In the past four Origin matches, the Maroons have scored 10 tries. Half of those came in the one match, after theJoseph-Aukuso Suaalii send-offin Sydney last year. Another three came in the second half of the MCG clash in which they trailed 34-0 at half-time. Wednesday\u2019s lone try came directly from a Mitchell handling error.The last time the Maroons crafted their own four-pointer in a tight contest against a full Blues contingent was in the fifth minute of last year\u2019s series, when Ben Hunt crossed from Daly Cherry-Evans\u2019 blindside sneak.The 36-year-old halfback became the oldest Origin player on Wednesday, but admitted the poor attacking return means his place in the team is now a matter of debate. \u201cWe\u2019ve opened ourselves up to these sorts of questions,\u201d Cherry-Evans said. \u201cBut yeah, I\u2019d love the opportunity to come back and correct it.\u201dThe coach said he too faces the same pressures. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the players, it\u2019s everyone, and we\u2019ll all look at ourselves.\u201d He said he still believes in the group, that the attitude of the squad was right even if their indiscipline let them down. And he said he feels responsible to help them find their best football.Slater has spent two decades taking rugby league by the scruff of the neck. But after three straight Origin defeats, this series might be out of his hands. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he admitted, \u201cit\u2019s got to come from the players.\u201d",

        "raw_text": "A dominant first half secured victory for New South Wales in theState of Originopener 18-6, leaving the Maroons with a huge task to claim the shield as the series shifts away from Queensland. The Maroons have now lost two games in a row at Suncorp Stadium for the first time since 1997, having also lost last year\u2019s decider. Indeed, the margin of victory for the favourites should have been greater were it not for struggles by Blues\u2019 kickers Nathan Cleary and Zac Lomax, who went one from five. NSW captain Isaah Yeo said team \u201chandled well\u201d uncertainty in the lead-up around injuries to influential players Payne Haas and Stephen Crichton, who were both close to their best on Wednesday. And Yeo revealed he now enjoys the experience of running out at Suncorp Stadium, describing it as a \u201cspecial\u201d place to play. \u201cTo come up here, and I thought our first half was half was exceptional,\u201d he said. His side scored three tries through silky backline play in the first half, two for winger Lomax down the right and one for Brian To\u2019o on the other side of the field. The To\u2019o four-pointer was the highlight thanks to a brilliant catch and pass from Latrell Mitchell, who found his outside man under heavy pressure from the rushing Queensland defence. Much of the pre-match discussion had centred around the ability of the Maroons\u2019 rookie centre Rob Toia to be able to contain Mitchell. Ultimately the 20-year-old acquitted himself well, and it was actually the Blues centre who experienced a mixed night. His handling error directly led to the Maroons\u2019 only try early in the second half, scored by Xavier Coates. But it proved little more than a footnote for NSW, who have now won three straight Origin contests and look almost unbeatable in 2025. Victory was sealed with seven minutes to go with a miracle try for fullback Dylan Edwards. Sustained Blues pressure on the Maroons\u2019 line ended with a kick and one-handed take from Lomax, who then found Connor Watson. The danger seemed to be extinguished when Watson was wrapped up by three defenders. But he managed to pass the ball back to Edwards, who mashed it into the ground to put the game beyond doubt. While the Blues controlled much of the match, the contest erupted early in the second half. The Blues were seeking to limit the damage during a period with To\u2019o in the sin bin. Despite early errors, it looked they had done it too, when the Maroons butchered a scrum play 10m from the Blues\u2019 line. But on the first tackle, Jeremiah Nanai dislodged the ball from Mitchell and Coates scurried across in the corner. Despite the missed Valentine Holmes conversion, there was newfound energy in a stadium that had been flat in the first half. It was amplified when crowd favourite Tom Dearden came on to spell Harry Grant at hooker. A succession of kicks pinned the Blues back, a run of repeat sets finally ending when Lomax swooped on a Cam Munster grubber, keeping the ball in play and winning a penalty. That was as close as the Maroons would come, as errors mounted for both sides before Edwards\u2019 match-sealing try. The home side appeared to finally cross with a minute to go, but Holmes\u2019 try was ruled out due to a forward pass. Sign up toAustralia Sport Get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk after newsletter promotion Queensland were lucky to escape the first half down only 14-2 after a powerful period from the Blues. The visitors dominated yardage, out-gaining the Maroons 1,000m to 600m with tackles 233 to 162. For 39 minutes, set after set ended up down the Maroons\u2019 end, and the match appeared destined for a New South Wales victory. But Queensland swung momentum back thanks to Coates, their towering right winger and best player on the night. With less than a minute to go before half-time, he forced his opponent To\u2019o into a handling error off a kick, and then in the last play of the half, baited To\u2019o into grabbing in a subsequent aerial contest. The result was Queensland\u2019s first points, a sin bin for To\u2019o, and hope for the capacity crowd of more than 54,000 at Suncorp Stadium. That hoped proved short-lived, and now the pressure mounts on the Maroons to produce in Perth in game two next month in a bid to keep the series alive for the decider in Sydney in July. Ominously for Queensland, the Blues feel they can improve. \u201cThere\u2019s areas in our game that we can get better at, which is exciting,\u201d Yeo said. \u201cI\u2019d like to think we take some confidence out of it, but it\u2019s a long way to go.\u201d",

Aftertwo humbling defeats to New South Wales, Queensland\u2019s players are at risk of suffering the ignominy of thefirst women\u2019s Origin clean sweepsince the series was extended to three games last season. \u201cThe shield\u2019s gone, but we still have plenty to play for,\u201d Maddick said ahead of her Origin debut. \u201cWe\u2019ve got family coming down, we\u2019ve got people watching the game, and we\u2019re playing for a bit of dignity.\u201d Queensland fought back in last year\u2019s series toclaim game twoandthen the decider, but this year the contest has been more one-sided. The Blues have been dominant in the first two games \u2013 with32\u201312and26\u20136victories \u2013 and the Maroons\u2019 fortunes took another blow when Jillaroos fullback Tamika Upton was ruled out of the third match. The 33-year-old Maddick\u2019s football fate has long been intertwined with Upton\u2019s. They both enjoyed outstanding touch football careers before joining the Broncos in theNRLWand both are elusive ball runners and playmakers. Maddick describes Upton, who is five years younger than her, as one of her best friends. The pair will even reunite at the Broncos this year after Upton\u2019s departure from the Knights. Maddick\u2019s elevation from Maroons backup looked likely when Upton went down clutching her leg, but her debut was not guaranteed until a call from coach Tahnee Norris. \u201cI saw her calling and my heart started racing,\u201d Maddick said. The former NRL touch player of the year only debuted in the NRLW in her late 20s, and speaks with reverence about the likes of Upton and Tarryn Aiken. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, because I\u2019m inspired by so many people that are so much younger than me, and I love listening to them speak and the way they think about the game, like Tamika and Tarryn,\u201d Maddick said. She was invited to trial with the NRLW Broncos in 2020 but actually turned down her first contract offer. \u201cI was probably a little bit naive,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to keep playing touch [football]. But the second I said no, I regretted it.\u201d Maddick is now making up for lost time, and in 2024 produced the best season of her short career. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual in women\u2019s sport, because everyone has a different background, but I only really started playing footy seriously in my late 20s, and in all honesty, it felt like last year I\u2019ve finally got a grasp on the game properly.\u201d She will face a confident Blues line-up, who made the most of anerror-ridden Maroons in game oneandadjusted better to torrential rain in game two. \u201cConditions really were awful in the last game, so that obviously changes a lot of things in the style that you want to play,\u201d Maddick said. Sign up toAustralia Sport Get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk after newsletter promotion \u201cIt probably benefited New South Wales and the fact that they\u2019ve got really big, strong girls, I think we\u2019ve got really good, crafty, smart players, but conditions didn\u2019t really allow for a lot of ball movement.\u201d The Maroons must also overcome an opponent buoyed by strong home support in Newcastle, the city which has become the capital for women\u2019s rugby league. But the team remains optimistic given the outcome at McDonald Jones Stadium last year, whenLauren Brown slotted a late field goalthat swung momentum to the Maroons on their way to the shield. A near-capacity crowd of 25,782 attended that night despite the inclement weather, underlining the emergence of the women\u2019s game. \u201cI\u2019d love to be a teenager at this point coming into the game now,\u201d Maddick said. But she noted it still had some way to go. \u201cI hope it gets to a full-time wage \u2013 at the moment, it\u2019s not \u2013 but even still, just being a part of it while it\u2019s growing to that point is exciting.\u201d",

        "raw_text": "Alexei Popyrin has broken more fresh ground in his soaring career as he brightened up a gloomy day in Paris by reaching the third round of theFrench Openfor the first time. But while the 25th seed was battling his way past Chilean Alejandro Tabilo, 7-5 6-3 6-4 on a drizzle-splattered outside court, Ajla Tomljanovic\u2019s big date under the roof of Court Phillippe Chatrier turned into a bit of a damp squib as she succumbed 6-3 6-3 to 2024 finalist Jasmine Paolini. The two matches ended within 30 seconds of each other on Wednesday with Popyrin\u2019s delight at overcoming a potentially tricky hurdle in stark contrast to Tomljanovic\u2019s frustration at not being able to offer more of a threat to the Italian No 4 seed amid a second-set fightback. Popyrin, the lanky Sydneysider who made history last year by becoming the first Australian in a generationto win a Masters 1000 event, always held the initiative against Tabilo, a dangerous opponent on all surfaces who beat Novak Djokovic on clay in Rome last year. Having ended his six-match losing sequence at Roland Garros in the first round, Popyrin was left delighted to become the first Australian to advance to the last-32 this year \u2013 and so far without dropping a set. He will now play the Portuguese player Nuno Borges after he beat an injury-hit Casper Ruud (7) 2-6 6-4 6-1 6-0. On an awkward morning with dark clouds gathering and spots of rain threatening stoppages throughout, Popyrin was also grateful at getting an efficient job done in two-and-a-quarter hours before the rain began to settle in and interrupt the programme. Rewarded for his more attacking approach against the southpaw counter-puncher, Popyrin was ahead in all the key departments, firing 37 winners to Tabilo\u2019s 25, making 10 less unforced errors than the Chilean and proving more adventurous with his 37 sojourns to the net, winning 76% of those points. His six breaks of serve were answered by just a couple from the Chilean, with the key moments really emerging near the end of a tight first set when, after having an earlier set point repelled amid Tabilo\u2019s counter-attack, Popyrin finally broke through after 50 minutes. Victorious in the boys\u2019 championship at Roland Garros eight years ago, Popyrin is now enjoying his best run at the Paris slam at the end of a claycourt season in which he reached quarter-finals in Monte Carlo and Geneva. Sign up toAustralia Sport Get a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports desk after newsletter promotion Popyrin finally got the job done with a brilliant cross-court winner, just before a double fault from Tomljanovic finally ended her more robust second-set effort against Paolini. After her opening-round win over young Aussie star Maya Joint, Tomljanovic had harboured some hopes that a similar all-out attack might unsettle the Italian. Instead, Paolini largely proved the aggressor, maintaining the form that\u2019s just driven her to become the first home Italian Open champ for 40 years. In a match where both players shared 58 errors between them, it was Paolini\u2019s 24 winners, including some striking work at the net, which demonstrated her superiority.",

        "raw_text": "There were 65 minutes on the clock when a chill spread around Stadion Wroclaw and Real Betis\u2019s flame fizzled out. That was the moment when Cold Palmer finally emerged, decided that enough was enough and took an icy hold on a final that was in danger of running away from Chelsea. That was the moment when disaster was averted, Betis\u2019s hopes of winning the Uefa Conference League faded and it became clear that Todd Boehly, Behdad Eghbali and the rest of Chelsea\u2019s leadership team would be on the pitch at full time, drinking it all in after claiming their first piece of silverware in the men\u2019s game since their takeover in 2022. The predictability of the outcome did not make the feeling any less sweet for Boehly and Eghbali after a season that began with their differences getting a very public airing. Really, though, this was all about one very special individual. There have been countless signings under thisChelseaownership but none as smart as the \u00a340m spent on buying Palmer from Manchester City. He is a unique talent, a maverick whose personality and skill defined this contest. So what if Chelsea still resemble Cole Palmer FC in times of trouble? They would have been lost without him accepting the responsibility of scrubbing out Betis\u2019s 1-0 lead by sparking a turnaround with gorgeous assists for Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez and Nicolas Jackson. There could be no better demonstration of why Palmer deserves to hear the Champions League anthem before his next European assignment. It was an astonishing five minutes from the 23-year-old. Betis chased their first European trophy but the financial gulf told in the end. There was no romance in Manuel Pellegrini, the 71-year-old Chilean, and his band of Premier League cast-offs running out of steam succumbing to a 4-1 defeat after further strikes from Mois\u00e9s Caicedo and Jadon Sancho, who will hope he has done enough for his loan from Manchester United to be made permanent. The weird thing is that Chelsea were booed off at half-time. They were appalling during the first half, falling behind to a sloppy goal and offering nothing in attack. Enzo Maresca, who delighted insticking it to his criticsafter clinching Champions League qualification last weekend, got his initial tactics badly wrong. Malo Gusto, a right-back by trade, had a nightmare as an auxiliary midfielder. Betis led through Abde Ezzalzouli and could have had more. It was just as well that Chelsea emerged with more intensity in the second half. It had been a relief to focus on the football after two daysmarred by idiotic violence involving supportersof both sides in the city centre. The longing came from Betis, who were thrilled to be in their first European final. Chelsea, by contrast, did not fill their allocation. They struggled during the first 30 minutes. The mind went back to Gary Neville branding Chelsea \u201cbillion-pound bottle jobs\u201d after they lost to Liverpool\u2019s kids in last season\u2019s Carabao Cup final. The touches were loose and the early tactical battle was won by Pellegrini targeting the space left by Gusto drifting inside from right-back. The Frenchman was one of five changes from Maresca and was culpable when Betis scored in the ninth minute, a slack pass into midfield intercepted, leaving Isco to send Ezzalzouli through to fire a low shot past Filip J\u00f6rgensen. Chelsea were shambolic. Ezzalzouli was tormenting Gusto. Isco, a European champion on five occasions with Real Madrid, was running the show. J\u00f6rgensen saved from Marc Bartra and Beno\u00eet Badiashile made a vital block to deny Johnny Cardoso. Maresca, who calls Pellegrini his footballing father, used the break to correct his error of leaving out Reece James. The captain came on for Gusto and gave Chelsea more poise on the right. The mood shifted, Betis tiring. Antony was the Antony of Manchester United on the Betis right. Ezzalzouli limping off was a blow for Pellegrini. Chelsea took control in midfield, Fern\u00e1ndez and Caicedo dominating. But still we waited for Palmer. He has struggled since Christmas. The goals and assists have dried up. He picked a good moment to stir. His influence grew and Chelsea were level when he lifted in a feathery cross for Fern\u00e1ndez, who ghosted in to head past Adri\u00e1n. Now Palmer was irrepressible. Soon he twisted past the Betis substitute, Jes\u00fas Rodr\u00edguez, and slammed in another cross from the right for Jackson to chest home. Consider the striker\u2019s debt owed to his teammate after his recent red card against Newcastle repaid. Chelsea did not look back after going 2-1 up. Two substitutes combined, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall setting up Sancho to whip a shot past Adri\u00e1n. Caicedo, who was outstanding, then fired home from 20 yards. This was the only European trophy missing for Chelsea. They can say they have won it all again. Boehly and Eghbali will hope this is the first of many for this young group.",

Swiatek, a four-time French Open champion and the fifth seed in Paris this year, produced an imperious performanceto defeat the Briton 6-1, 6-2and reach the third round. Swiatek is attempting to win her fourth successive French Open singles title, a feat that has never been achieved by a female player in the open era. \u201cIga played really well today,\u201d Raducanu said. \u201cI think every time we have played she plays really well. It puts a lot of pressure on me from the beginning, makes me feel like I have to maybe do something extra or I just don\u2019t know what to do in the moment. It does shift the dynamics of the match a bit, and then it\u2019s very difficult to stay with her as she grows in confidence. It just shows, I guess, the distance that I have to improve.\u201d Although she has performed well against lower-ranked players recently, Raducanu has one win and 10 defeats in her matches against players in the top eight in her career, winning only one set in those 10 defeats.

Along with her far superior level and achievements, Swiatek notes that Raducanu just feels like a good matchup to her. \u201cThere are players that just have the ball; that for some of us it\u2019s a little bit easier, others don\u2019t like it,\u201d Swiatek said. \u201cThere are some players that you just kind of know what you\u2019re going to do a little bit.

        "raw_text": "Just a couple of weeks after stressing the importance of playing against the best players in the world more frequently in order to improve her own game,Emma Raducanuwalked out on to Court Philippe\u2011Chatrier on Wednesday afternoon facing the toughest challenge in her sport. The task of playing Iga Swiatek at theFrench Open, her fortress, was unsurprisingly too much for Raducanu and in the second successive grand slam tournament she was dismantled by her imperious opponent, the fifth seed, who eased into the third round at Roland Garros with a 6-1, 6-2 win. As she chases one of the greatest achievements in the open era of women\u2019s tennis \u2013 an unprecedentedfourth successive titleat Roland Garros \u2013 Swiatek\u2019s astounding record at the tournament now stands 37-2 (95%): 33 of those wins have been effortlessly earned in straight sets. After demolishing Raducanu 6-0, 6-1in the third roundof the Australian Open in January, Swiatek now holds a 5-0 record against the Briton. Before the match, during an interview with Tim Henman for TNT Sports, Raducanu\u2019s ad hoc coach Mark Petchey was asked what his charge would have to do well in order to defeat Swiatek. His answer was immediate and blunt: \u201cEverything.\u201d The pressure that Swiatek places on her opponents to play past their limits was immediately evident on Raducanu\u2019s serve as she went big at the very first moment. After missing a 180kmh first serve on the opening point, the same speed as her fastest first serve after nearly three hours on court in her first\u2011round match, Raducanu successfully landed a 158kmh second serve. The 22\u2011year\u2011old confidently navigated her first service game well, looking to impose herself with her forehand. Those positive feelings did not last. On Swiatek\u2019s serve, Raducanu took an advanced return position on both first and second serves as she tried to put pressure on her opponent\u2019s second serve, an essential tactic for any player who wishes to hurt the Pole. In the end, even dealing with the topspin behind Swiatek\u2019s second serve on the high-bouncing clay was a struggle. Although she was relatively erratic early on in tough breezy conditions, Swiatek gradually settled down and established total control of the exchanges. The 23-year-old continually forced Raducanu into defensive positions, suffocating her opponent with the weight of her heavy topspin forehand. Raducanu tried to step forward and take the ball on the rise, but Swiatek\u2019s topspin constantly spun up high outside her strike zone and neutered her ball. It is easy to suggest that a clear underdog should be able to swing freely and without pressure, but Swiatek has produced these dominant results againstalmostevery single player on the tour at one time. Time and time again, she has shown that the incessant pressure she imposes on her opponents is usually enough. Not only did she dictate the vast majority of the match from the baseline, when Raducanu tried to take control of points Swiatek soaked up the Briton\u2019s first strike with her supreme defence. Forced to attack as early as she can and aim closer and closer to the lines, Raducanu\u2019s errors piled up. As Raducanu neatly stated before the match, Swiatek makes her side of the court feel narrow due to her defensive skills and her opponents\u2019 side feel wide thanks to her massive weapons. This was plain for all to see on another difficult afternoon for Raducanu, as the four-time French Open champion marched on. Taking positives from such an emphatic defeat is difficult, but Raducanu\u2019s progress over the past few months, both on clay courts and within her game in general, has been undeniable. She will return to the top 40, around No 37, and should head to the grass-court season confident in her abilities to make deep runs on one of her favourite surfaces. Still, these stark defeats against the best players in the world have shown how wide the gulf remains between them and the significant work Raducanu has ahead of her to narrow it. Elsewhere, Aryna Sabalenka, the top seed, followed the lead set by Swiatek, her great rival, with a dominant performance of her own as she eased into the third round with a 6-3, 6-1 win against Jil Teichmann. In the men\u2019s draw, the second seed Carlos Alcaraz continued to build momentum in his title defence as he advanced to the third round with a 6-1, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory against Fabian Marozsan. Casper Ruud, the seventh seed and two-time French Open finalist, endured a shock 2-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-0 defeat by Nuno Borges of Portugal. Afterwards, he disclosed that he had been struggling with a knee injury for some time. \u201cIt\u2019s hopefully nothing too serious,\u201d Ruud said. \u201cFor the last couple of weeks I\u2019ve been kind of struggling a little bit with knee pain on and off. That\u2019s why I decided to pull out of Geneva after Rome, do my best, and heal to be ready here. When you\u2019re practicing, leading up to the tournament, it\u2019s easier to avoid certain movements that are painful. Everything is not painful. But certain movements out there are kind of what makes it painful.\u201d",

        "raw_text": "Lamine Yamal,Barcelonaand Spain\u2019s football sensation, has delayed the official photoshoot for the signing of his new club contract so that his grandmother can be present. The 17-year-old, who has won hearts and minds not just with his talent on the pitch but for his humility, credits Fatima, his paternal grandmother, with keeping his feet on the ground after his parents separated when he was three years old. Barcelona announced on Tuesday that Lamine Yamal had signed a new contract in the presence of the club president, Joan Laporta, and sporting director Deco. The deal keeps him at the club until 2031, when he will still be only 24, and has a buyout clause of \u20ac1bn (\u00a3840m). However, the official photo session for the signing was postponed until July, when Lamine Yamal turns 18, because Fatima was unable to attend on Tuesday. Fatima left Morocco in 1990 and arrived in Barcelona accompanied by her five children, among them Lamine Yamal\u2019s father, Mounir Nasraoui. She played a key role in Lamine Yamal\u2019s upbringing after his mother, Sheila Ebana, from Equatorial Guinea, and Nasraoui separated. When Lamine Yamal offered to buy Fatima a house she refused, saying she preferred to stay where she was in Rocafonda, the working-class neighbourhood in Matar\u00f3, a coastal town north of Barcelona. True to his origins, Lamine Yamal celebrates his goals with his handsforming the numbers 304, the Rocafonda postal code. Sign up toFootball Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion Alreadyrated by many punditsas the best player in the world, he signed for Barcelona in 2014 when he was six years old, and was raised in La Masia, the club\u2019s famous school-cum-football academy. He made his first-team debut in 2023. At the Uefa European Championship last year he became the youngest player to appear in the competition,scoring the goal of the tournamentagainst France in the semi-finals. During the competition, which was held in Germany, Spain\u2019s use of their young star was constrained by local labour laws that forbid anyone under 18 to work after 8pm. Last year Lamine Yamal became the youngest player to be nominated for the coveted Ballon d\u2019Or, winning the Kopa Trophy for best young player. At 16 he broke the record held by his Barcelona teammate Gavi as Spain\u2019s youngest goalscorer.",

        "raw_text": "Manchester United\u2019s post-season tour followed their late-season form as Ruben Amorim\u2019s team lost 1-0 to a scratch team of Asean All-Stars in Kuala Lumpur. United\u2019s latest defeat, part of a lucrative end-of-season tour in the wake of their 15th-placed finish in the Premier League, came after the players had been paraded through the streets of the Malaysian capital. Three days after closing out their Premier League campaign with acontroversial victory against Aston Villa, a much-changed United team faced a side pulled together for a one-off occasion. Harry Maguire led the side. Casemiro, Patrick Dorgu, Andr\u00e9 Onana, Ayden Heaven, Diogo Dalot, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus H\u00f8jlund started while Alejandro Garnacho and Bruno Fernandes, both linked with summer moves, played from the bench as part of 11 half-time changes. It was Maung Maung Lwin, a Burmese winger for Thai League 1 club Lamphun Warriors, who netted a 71st-minute winner for the south-east Asian team. United could not shake off their season\u2019s travails, including last week\u2019sloss in the Europa League final, and played disjointedly. Several youth products were given their turn, which heartened Amorim amid his disappointment at the result. He said: \u201cNo injuries and a tough pitch. We don\u2019t have it in us not to choke in every exercise, in every game \u2013 that is what happened. We should win these kind of games, no matter what. We need to bring that inside of us in every game. \u201cThe important thing is no injuries with this weather and to arrive here in this day. It is not an excuse, we should perform better. I liked the young kids, they try. That\u2019s enough for me in the moment. They want to play more but we have to rotate everybody to play. They did well.\u201d United play another friendly in Hong Kong on Friday to end a tour reportedly set to earn the club \u00a38m. Before Wednesday\u2019s opening game, the club\u2019s chief executive, Omar Berrada, had put a positive spin on United\u2019s end to the season and what lies ahead in the transfer window. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about specifics, but I can say that we\u2019ve been planning for many months now,\u201d Berrarda told MUTV. \u201cWe were ready for all the different scenarios, so now we know what we need to do.

The 24-year-old died after being restrained by police who intervened during an altercation at a Coles supermarket. McCarthy told ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing: Even the high rates of incarceration of First Nations people is a matter of concern across Australia, but especially here in the Northern Territory. We have to look at these issues, we have to look at the opportunity for anything other than jail time. McCarthy said the man\u2019s death had led to an \u201cincredibly difficult\u201d and \u201cvery traumatic time for families\u201d.

This has not taken into account climate impact \u2026 This is a project that is being approved through 2070,when my kids will be grandparents, and I just don\u2019t buy that this is a necessary decision to make now, given what we know about the climate impact of the project.

Hogan went on to say that Dutton\u2019s shadow cabinet had a similar make-up of men and women in the last parliament, but \u201cthat made no difference to people\u2019s voting intentions\u201d. But I take your point. You can read more here: The Australian Electoral Commission hasconfirmed upper house results in WA and Queensland today, with exactly the same results in both states: With six seats on offer in each, both have elected two Labor, two Coalition, one Green andone from One Nation. In QLD, the LNP\u2019s Paul Scarr was first elected, alongside colleague Susan McDonald; Nita Green from Labor was elected second, alongside Corinne Mulholland. Larissa Waters, the Greens leader, came fifth and Pauline Hanson\u2019s deputyMalcolm Roberts came in sixth position. In WA, Labor\u2019s Ellie Whiteaker was first elected, alongside Varun Ghosh; Slade Brockman for the Liberals was second, with Matt O\u2019Sullivan; the Greens\u2019 Jordon Steele-John was re-elected in fourth spot, with Whitten coming sixth. It will take One Nation to three senators, alongside Hanson who is up for election next term. Whitten, according to a bio on One Nation\u2019s website, \u201cbelieves in a strong national energy policy that prioritises Australian resources, making power more affordable and reliable. He will also fight to end the reckless mass immigration policies that are driving up housing costs and putting immense strain on infrastructure and essential services\u201d. The bio adds: Our government is selling out Australians with policies that benefit corporations and global bureaucracies while leaving our own people struggling. It\u2019s time to put Australians first. Ayres says Albanese will stand up for Australia if he speaks with Donald Trump at G7 next month The ABC\u2019s Patricia Karvelas asked Ayres how the prime minister will advocate for the country after the tariff ruling at next month\u2019s G7 summit in Canada. He said: I think what you\u2019d expect to see is Anthony Albanese as the Australian prime minister standing up for Australia\u2019s interest in a calm and consistent way. It certainly won\u2019t be, as you say, begging any global leader for anything. We do things the Australian way here. Tim Ayres says Labor will keep pushing Australian interests after US court blocks Trump tariffs Industry and science minister Tim Ayres said the Labor government would continue to focus on advancing Australia\u2019s interests, saying he wasreluctant to commentona recent court rulingthat blocked US president Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cliberation day\u201d tariffs. Ayers said the most \u201csensible\u201d approach would be to wait and see what happens in the US court system rather than get too excited by the move, adding to the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing: What we want to do is keep squarely focused on Australia\u2019s interest \u2026 [The tariffs are] an unwelcome development in terms of the bilateral relationship, the bilateral economic relationship, but what I\u2019m concerned about as well, and the government is concerned about, is the impact on the rules-based order and the global trading system that Australia relies upon so much. Queensland begins review of puberty blockers Queensland\u2019s review of puberty blockers has begun.HealthministerTim Nichollsbanned all public prescribing of puberty blockers for transgender children in January. They are still available for cisgender children. He also ordered a review to be led by psychiatrist Ruth Vine. It will inquire into \u201cthe strength of the evidence base for using Stage 1 and Stage 2 hormones to treat gender dysphoria\u201d among other things. According to its terms of reference, the review \u201cmay consider\u201d published grey literature, including the Cass Review which led to a ban on prescribing puberty blockers in the United Kingdom. A review completed last yearrecommended the state government double fundingfor the Brisbane-based Queensland Children\u2019s Gender Service and improve regional coverage. Nicholls has announced the government will not implement its recommendations. A range of health bodies including the Australian Medical Association called for the ban to be lifted. Queensland Health director general David Rosengren said the state government had commissioned an independent review because \u201cthe evidence supporting the use of these therapies is contested\u201d. Public consultation was opened today. It closes on 29 July. The review is due to be completed by 30 November.

We\u2019ve reported in recent days on Labor grassroots members urging the government to go further,including considering sanctions on Israel and recognising Palestine. Former foreign ministers Bob Carr and Gareth Evans have also lent their weight to such calls. The state secretary of the Victorian branch of the Australian Manufacturing Workers\u2019 Union (AMWU),Tony Mavromatis, said the Labor government should move toward recognition of Palestinian statehood, sanctions on the Netanyahu government, an increase in humanitarian aid and for a genuine ceasefire in Gaza. Mavromatis said: Now that the Albanese Labor government has been re-elected with a large majority, it is the opportune time to take a bold stand on this and other issues. We just came out of a highly contested election where the Palestinian issue featured prominently. My members see the result as an endorsement of Labor\u2019s policy on Palestine, which calls for recognition before a solution is reached. As a union that has been active and vocal on Palestine, we lend our support to all those within the Labor caucus and movement to urge the prime minister and the foreign minister to announce Australia\u2019s recognition of Palestinian statehood at next month\u2019s UN high-level conference co-hosted by France and Saudi Arabia. Mavromatis said AMWU members weresupportive of sanctions on individuals and institutions guilty of human rights violations, and backed protests against the Netanyahu government. He added: The Australian Labor government needs to persist with calling for the immediate and genuine ceasefire in Gaza, an end of encroachment by Israeli settlers, militia and military into the West Bank, the full reinstatement and increase of humanitarian aid to Gaza and the West Bank, including the continued stabilization of UNWRA, and respect for international law and human rights.

More than 7,000 insurance claims from NSW regions affected by floods Insurers have received more than 7,000 claims from the mid north coast and Hunter regions affected by floods, the Insurance Council of Australia says. There were about 6,000 claimsyesterday. \u201cClaims numbers have been steadily increasing over the past week as residents and business owners have been able to get back into properties to assess the damage and begin the clean-up,\u201d ICA said in a statement. The Insurance Council and insurers are focused on assisting communities in the recovery and have prioritised making clean-up and claims guidance as accessible as possible. This includes direct text messages to policyholders, updates in insurer apps, and having representatives on the ground in centres across the region. There are now Insurance Hubs in Taree and Port Macquarie. Inside the Bradfield recount: painstaking and polite, but sometimes heartbreaking The Bradfield recount is being held in a warehouse in Asquith that appears to have been used for a number of northern Sydney electorates, but on my visit only Bradfield is being counted. A space is set aside as a break room for scrutineers, with large teams for the teal candidate,Nicolette Boele,and the Liberal,Gisele Kapterian,whofinished just eight votes aheadafter the first complete count. Given there weremore than 6,500 informal votes in Bradfield(5.51% of those cast), the potential for decisions over validity to settle the outcome are obvious. Each candidate has at least enough scrutineers to have one watching every person counting. The regular counting space is divided into a series of bays. Each bay is dealing with one polling place at a time. The first part of the process is to conduct a fresh first-preference count. Ballot papers are already in bundles of 50, in first preference order. Each counter takes one bundle at a time and removes the rubber band, then carefully checks each ballot to ensure it is formal and that the first preference is correct. It is then laid on a pile facing the scrutineers, who can observe it. This process happens more slowly and carefully than you would expect for an election night count.

        "raw_text": "Australia will continue to push Donald Trump to abandon his administration\u2019s tariff regime entirely, after aUS court blocked the president\u2019s \u201cliberation day\u201d tariffsfrom coming into effect. The Manhattan-based court of international trade said the US constitution gives the Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other countries, and ruled that power was not superseded by the president\u2019s self-declared \u201cemergency\u201d he cited to safeguard the US economy. The Trump White House filed an appeal against the judgment minutes after it was handed down. The regime imposed a10% across-the-board tariff on all Australian importsto the US. Several specific products, includingsteelandaluminium, are subject to higher tariff rates, up to 25%, which are not impacted by the court\u2019s ruling. The Australian trade minister, Don Farrell, said the Australian government would agitate for tariffs on Australian goods to be dumped entirely. \u201cWe will study this ruling of the US Federal Courts on reciprocal tariffs closely and note that they may be subject to further legal processes through the courts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Albanese Government has been consistent in the view that these tariffs on Australian imports into the US are unjustified,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cWe will continue to engage and strongly advocate for the removal of tariffs.\u201d \u201cThe Albanese Government will always stand up for Australia\u2019s national interests, including Australian jobs and Australian industries.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The US court found Trump overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board tariffs on imports from countries all over the world.Trump called the tariffs, announced on 2 April,America\u2019s \u201cliberation day\u201d. \u201cThe court does not pass upon the wisdom or likely effectiveness of the President\u2019s use of tariffs as leverage. That use is impermissible not because it is unwise or ineffective, but because (federal law) does not allow it,\u201d a three-judge panel said in the decision. The ruling came in a pair of lawsuits, one filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small US businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties and the other by 13 US states. The companies \u2013 which range from a New York wine and spirits importer to a Virginia-based maker of educational kits and musical instruments \u2013 have said the tariffs will hurt their ability to do business. The lawsuit argued that the statue invoked by the president \u2013 the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) \u2013 does not give him the authority to unilaterally issue across-the-board worldwide tariffs. \u201cHis claimed emergency is a figment of his own imagination: trade deficits, which have persisted for decades without causing economic harm, are not an emergency. Nor do these trade deficits constitute an \u2018unusual and extraordinary threat\u2019,\u201d it argued. Court documents specifically cited thetariffs imposed on Australian territories where there are no people, and, hence, no commerce. \u201cThe Liberation Day Order imposed sweeping new tariffs at rates not seen since the Great Depression \u2013 including a global 10% tariffs on nearly all countries in the world \u2013 regardless of whether they impose tariffs on United States products, the rates at which they do so, or the existence of any trade agreements governing the relationship. \u201cThese tariffs even applied to places with no civilian population or international trade activity, such as [Australian territories] the Heard and McDonald Islands, which are inhabited only by penguins and seals.\u201d Australian financial analysts have warned that significant uncertainty remained around the ultimate fate of Trump\u2019s tariff regime. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst with Capital.com in Melbourne, said the court\u2019s ruling was massive news. \u201cIt\u2019s long been suggested that the emergency powers Trump has used to implement tariffs were unconstitutional and that the power to enact tariffs sits with Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sets up a battle that will likely end up in the supreme court now. It\u2019s a situation fraught with danger because the administration may ignore the court\u2019s ruling, potentially placing greater strain on US institutions at a time of increased stress.\u201d Sean Callow, a senior analyst at ITC Markets in Sydney, said while there must be significant caution over the ruling being overturned by higher courts, \u201cfor now the weight of money is being placed on the possibility that US courts prevent the White House from self-imposed economic damage, brightening US growth prospects and the US dollar\u201d. The White House and lawyers for groups that sued did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff and one of Trump\u2019s lead policy advisers, rebuked the court in a brief social media post, writing: \u201cThe judicial coup is out of control.\u201d At least five other legal challenges to the tariffs are pending. The attorney general of Oregon, Dan Rayfield, a Democrat whose office is leading the states\u2019 lawsuit, called Trump\u2019s tariffs unlawful, reckless and economically devastating. \u201cThis ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can\u2019t be made on the president\u2019s whim,\u201d Rayfield said in a statement. Under US law, tariffs must typically be approved by Congress. Trump has claimed broad authority to set tariffs under IEEPA, which is meant to address \u201cunusual and extraordinary\u201d threats during a national emergency. The law has historically been used to impose sanctions on enemies of the US or freeze their assets. Trump is the first US president to use it to impose tariffs.

Here\u2019s are some highlights from a whirlwind day of news: TheLiberals and the Nationals have settled their disputeand reformed the Coalition after a week-long fissure. Sussan LeyandDavid Littleproudunveiled their shadow ministry, which rewarded key supporters and saw others \u2013 includingJane Hume, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and Barnaby Joyce\u2013 demoted or relegated to the backbench. Anthony Albanesesaid Australia should\u201cfollow our own path\u201d on Israelafter other nations threatened to impose sanctions on the country. Environment ministerMurray Wattgave the green light to Woodside Energy\u2019s plans toextend the lifeof the controversial North West Shelf gas development to 2070. Watt said there are \u201cstrict conditions\u201d on the plan, but it has already prompted concerns from experts about ongoing pollution. The UN group Unesco hasdeferred a decision to grant world heritage statusto theMurujuga cultural landscape, home to more than 1m petroglyphs, some of which are nearly 50,000 years old. The move is linked to Woodside Energy and other fossil fuel projects. About9,000 people are still isolatedafter the NSW floods. SES officials have declared more than 1,000 buildings uninhabitable after the event. More than 6,000 insurance claims have already been filed. Teslaisone step closer to opening a factoryin an Adelaide suburb despite overwhelming community opposition. Eggs costalmost 20% morethan a year ago, according to this morning\u2019s consumer price report. Inflation issteady at 2.4%. See you bright and early tomorrow morning. Environmental law group says it\u2019s \u2018no surprise\u2019 energy companies want to \u2018avoid legal scrutiny\u2019 The Environmental Defenders Office has responded to comments by Santos chief executive, Kevin Gallagher, at the Australian Energy Producers conference earlier today. Gallagher said environmental charities that mount legal challenges against big companies should have to disclose all of their financial backers. He was reflecting on the Munkara legal proceedings in the federal court that ended last year with the EDO ordered to pay Santos $9m in legal costs. EDO chief executive, David Morris, said: It comes as no surprise that the fossil fuel giants want to avoid legal scrutiny of their projects \u2026However, the public interest is not served by allowing these powerful vested interests to avoid the scrutiny and accountability that legal action provides. Community groups have a right to take legal action to ensure approval authorities and companies uphold the law. Indeed, many groups feel it is their duty to do so.\u201d Law groups calls for reform to whistleblower protections We reported earlier thatDavid McBride, a former military lawyer who leaked documents to the ABC, had lost an appeal to reduce his prison sentence. McBride was sentenced by the ACT supreme court last year to almost six years\u2019 imprisonment for leaking material later used by the ABC for an expos\u00e9 on alleged war crimes. His failed appeal has prompted theHuman Rights Law Centre, the Alliance for Journalists\u2019 Freedom and the Whistleblower Justice Fundto call on the Albanese Government to reform whistleblower protections. Kieran Pender, associate legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said: The truth should not be criminalised, yet Australia\u2019s broken whistleblower protection laws have led to numerous whistleblowers being prosecuted for speaking up. The Albanese government must act with urgent law reform and the establishment of a whistleblower protection authority, to ensure prosecutions like this never happen again. Whistleblowers should be protected, not punished. Small earthquake near Appin, NSW Geoscience Australia is reportinga small, 3.5-magnitude earthquaketook place near Appin, NSW, about 70km south of Sydney. The quake hit about 2.53pm. Barnaby Joyce says new shadow cabinet \u2018not generation change\u2019 Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce has rejected an assertion that thenewly unveiled shadow cabinetrepresented a new era for the Coalition on Afternoon Briefing. Joyce was among a handful demoted to the backbench this afternoon. Joyce said: I know David [Littleproud] is 48, fair enough, Kevin [Hogan] is 61, I\u2019m 58, so he\u2019s older than me. Bridget, 55, well, same area. \u2026 It is not generational change. So we have to be straight. It is a decision based on policy and personalities, and that\u2019s OK, that is absolutely the prerogative of the leader. Linda Burney calls death of Alice Springs man in custody a \u2018tragedy\u2019 Linda Burney described the death ofa 24-year-old Aboriginal man in custodyin Alice Springs yesterday as a \u201ctragedy\u201d on Afternoon Briefing. Host Patricia Karvelas asked if the man\u2019s death warranted a renewed effort to investigate the number of deaths in custody. Burney said: I think it does need revisiting. The deaths continue, of course they\u2019re disproportionate, because there is a disproportionate amount of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in jail and juvenile justice.

The partyreunited with the Liberalstoday after a dramatic split. The ABC\u2019s Patricia Karvelas asked if the mending was superficial. McKenzie replied: \u201cNot at all.\u201d She added to the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing: Now the fact that the Liberal party has agreed to our policy positions, that\u2019s a good thing. We always believe our country is best served by a strong, stable, Liberal-National coalition, and so today\u2019s announcement of a shadow ministry includes both political parties I think is an important thing for us to get into the election review proper and start taking up to the Labor government. She went on to say there needed to be an \u201celement of trust in a relationship that has been this longstanding\u201d.

He told ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing: I would make the case so we\u2019ve been strong in responding to climate change and we\u2019ve also been strong in using the law \u2026 in making this decision, relying on science Ed Husic has reiterated he believes it would be wise for Australia to impose targeted sanctions to oppose Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, \u201clooking at individuals who have been directing the operations\u201d in the region. He also said the government should be prepared for allies on the international stage to impose their own. Husic said on ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing: What I\u2019m trying to suggest is that we be prepared because if our friends and allies move on this, clearly the best option is to be a coordinated one. We need to use whatever mechanism we can to get the Israeli government \u2026 to recognise that its actions in enforcing this blockade is having a life or death impact on the most vulnerable.

NSW SES assistance commissioner Colin Malone said: We have teams on the ground and are working closely with recovery partners to provide support and assistance through a range of measures over the coming days. We are continuing to resupply isolated communities and we still have a few residual jobs to attend to, but with the assistance of our valued emergency service partners and community members mobilising to help we are working through them as quickly as possible. Anyone seeking flood recovery information can find thathere. Greens also unhappy with North West Shelf extension, will urge groups to take legal action The Greens say today\u2019s move has seen Labor fail its first climate test. The Greens leader, Larissa Waters, said in a statement: Sacrificing the oldest art gallery on the planet for Woodside\u2019s private profits while the Hunter has just experienced a 1-in-500 year flood event shows the climate madness this decision is. Approving fossil fuels out to 2070 totally undermines the government\u2019s commitment to net zero by 2050, which is already too late for a safe climate future. Waters said the Greens would encourage environmental groups to take legal action \u201cagainst this approval\u201d. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young called the extension an \u201cenvironmental disaster\u201d. The government has a choice this term \u2013 to work with the Greens in the Senate to insert a climate trigger into laws and ensure dirty projects are properly assessed for their impacts, or continue approving toxic coal and gas that sends our climate to collapse. Climate Council says Labor supporting \u2018massive climate bomb\u2019 with extension of gas facility The Climate Council has expressed deep disapproval after the Albanese government approved the extension of the contentious North West Shelf gas development until 2070. The group\u2019s CEO, Amanda McKenzie, said: Communities in NSW are starting the cleanup after record breaking floods. It is shocking that at the same time the Albanese government has approved this massive climate bomb as the first act of this term of government \u2026 If the government is actively making the climate crisis worse it must explain to communities, like those experiencing flooding right now, how it will protect them from more frequent and forceful extreme weather events. As reported earlier today, Unesco said such facilitiesshould be removed from the regionif Australia hopes to win world heritage listing for the area\u2019s 1 million rock carvings. Insurers have received more than 6,000 claims linked to the massive floods across NSW\u2019s mid-north coast, according to the Insurance Council of Australia \u2013 80% of those are linked to damage to homes. A hub to help process those claims has been set up at Taree Leagues Sports Centre and will run to 13 June. Andrew Hall, CEO of the council, said: It is confronting to see the extent of the damage across the region and it is clear the recovery is going to take some time and that means support must be ongoing. Insurers will continue to have a presence on the ground in impacted communities, and we urge anyone who needs help with their claim to come down to the hub and have a chat with the dedicated support staff. The group added it is too early to put a dollar figure on the total damage bill, but said it doesn\u2019t expect the number will be higher than the $6.4bn in losses incurred during the 2022 flooding. With that announcement wrapped up, I\u2019ll hand over toNick Visserto take you through the rest of the day\u2019s news. All the best. Sussan Leyhas said the culture of Parliament House must improve after SenatorFatima Paymanreported the behaviour of a male parliamentary colleague over claimed inappropriate comments. Ley said she was concerned by the news: I read that report with great concern and it is simply not good enough to have that behaviour take place in this building. It is vital that reporting of events like this are a reminder to everybody that we must never take our eye off the ball when it comes to continuous improvement in the culture in this building. Read the full report here: Littleproud denies demanding \u2018free for all\u2019 for shadow ministers David Littleproud has denied misleading his party room after Nationals MP Colin Boyce this morning accused his party leader of failing to raise a key issue believed to have motivated theCoalitionsplit. Liberal politicians said Littleproud had demanded shadow ministers be permitted to break shadow cabinet solidarity and cross the floor, which Nationals MPs said he had never discussed with them. Littleproud said he had never demanded a \u201cfree for all\u201d: It wasn\u2019t a demand, it was a conversation, and Sussan was quite clear that the parameters that we have were ones that we should continue to adhere to. I wasn\u2019t asking for a free for all and that was not something I think was appropriate to share \u2013 the fact that it\u2019s been ruminated out here \u2013 because I don\u2019t want a free for all in my party room. He said National party room members remained free to come forward and bring new policy or challenge existing policy. Disquiet among the Nationals MPs saw Barnaby Joyce endorse Michael McCormack to replace Littleproud as leader, but Littleproud denied McCormack was being punished for criticising him: I made it clear when I became leader three years ago that I wanted to have generational change but, at that point, wanted to respect the leadership that was before me to allow them to impart their wisdom. David Littleproud has refused to say whether he regretted his decision to split theCoalitionat a time Liberal leader Sussan Ley had left Canberra to be with her dying mother. Asked whether he had apologised to Ley for his decision, the Nationals leader said: With due respect, we made sure Sussan and I worked through that at a pace she was comfortable with \u2026 We were sensitive around that. So much so that \u2026 Sussan offered to fly back to Canberra to have our first meeting and I made it clear I didn\u2019t want her to leave her mother\u2019s side.",

        "raw_text": "The man who wrote the history of tax reform in Australia has called out the \u201cconfected outrage\u201d surrounding Labor\u2019s plan to trim concessions for wealthy Australians with super balances over $3m. Paul Tilley, the author of Changing Fortunes and a former senior Treasury official, said it was \u201cwell understood\u201d there were equity issues within the super system that needed to be addressed. \u201cThe problem is high-income earners would have to pay more tax, and they don\u2019t like it. This confected outrage is just because when you have a big tax concession and you pull it back, of course those who are benefiting from it are going to scream,\u201d he said. Since Labor\u2019s thumping election victory,there has been a campaign in major newspapers attacking the proposal, which will place an additional 15% tax on earnings on amounts over the $3m threshold. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The bill, which willneed the support of the Greens in the Senate, will affect the largest 0.5% of super balances, or about an estimated 80,000 people, and still leave highly favourable tax treatment for those affected. A Grattan Institute study concluded that \u201ctax-free retirement earnings turn super into ataxpayer-funded inheritance scheme\u201d. Despite its modest scope, the proposal has been met withclaims that, among other things, it will crush entrepreneurship and make Australia \u201cuninvestable\u201d; force farmers to sell their farms; and undermine the clean energy transition. The lead authors of the two most recent major inquiries into the superannuation system this week warnedthe \u201chysterical\u201d criticismof the plan risked undermining the case to make necessary changes aimed at making the super system more equitable and sustainable. One of the main points of contention is that the policy would apply the additional tax based on the notional change in the value of super balances during the financial year \u2013 an unusual arrangement in the tax system, that levies cash rather than \u201cunrealised\u201d profits. There have been warnings that those with farmland or business property in their super, typically in the subset self-managed funds, would be forced to sell to raise the money to pay the annual tax. But Tilley dismissed concerns around taxing unrealised gains in super, saying it was \u201cnot a problem\u201d, and that from a tax economist\u2019s point of view, was in fact the correct way to go about it. \u201cI don\u2019t think they [taxes on unrealised gains] are bad at all. The conceptually correct way to tax capital gains is on an accrual basis. We don\u2019t do it because the measurement and cashflow issues are a practical constraint. But in this case those measurement issues don\u2019t exist,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cashflow can be managed in the Apra-regulated funds. It\u2019s more of an issue in the SMSFs (self-managed super funds), but I don\u2019t think they are insurmountable.\u201d Tilley described Labor\u2019s measure as \u201cjust a very crude way to try to tackle the problem\u201d of overly generous super tax breaks at the top end. \u201cWhat you would like to do if it were administratively possible \u2013 and that\u2019s a big if \u2013 is tax the earnings at an individual\u2019s marginal tax rate minus 15-20%,\u201d he said. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Another concern among experts is that the policy in its current form would not be automatically adjusted each year for inflation or wages growth, which means it would progressively catch more Australians within its net. While Tilley described this as a \u201cside issue\u201d, many experts believe the bill should be amended to reflect this automatic adjustment. David Knox, a former senior partner at Mercer and one of the country\u2019s most distinguished actuaries, said he endorsed Labor\u2019s proposal in the name of fairness, but said he would prefer the $3m to be indexed. \u201cThose with lots of super benefits get a very good deal from the tax system and we want the system to be fair, and I think, therefore, it\u2019s appropriate that some form of extra taxation is applied to those with what I would call excessive benefits,\u201d Knox said. \u201cOn the unrealised gains I understand the issue, but I think one has to recognise we have to have a system or an operation that is relatively doable and that can be applied,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it is worth it just to get the worst of the excesses out of the system. Over time we have capped how much people can get into super, so this is a little bit of a legacy issue.\u201d Knox said that when it came to major overhauls of the system, international best practice was to not tax contributions and earnings in the accumulation phase, but then to tax income in retirement at the marginal rate. \u201cThe better reform is to tax super benefits when received in retirement,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother option or way forward would be for the government to say you are not allowed to have more than $3m or $5m in super, and if you do, you have to take it out.\u201d",

Man charged over alleged looting in mid-north coast after flooding A man has been charged over alleged looting in the flood-affected mid-north coast. At about 3.45am today, police were called to Mortimer Street in Wingham after concerns about suspicious activity. Police allegedly saw a man placing items into a hatchback. A police search of the vehicle found tools, paintings, family photos, DVDs, a fish tank, lamp, tyres and other personal items. The man, 44, was given a roadside drug test and allegedly returned a positive detection for methamphetamine. He has been charged with goods in personal custody being stolen and breach of bail. Manning/Great Lakes police district crime manager, Det InspNatalie Antaw, said extra resources had been assigned to prevent offending in the area. \u201cWe encourage the public to report any suspicious behaviour to police as soon as possible so that we can take action,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d also like to remind people that taking any goods that are not yours, no matter where they are found, is an offence \u2013 even if the items have been moved from their original place by flood waters.\u201d NT police say senior commissioned officer placed in charge of investigating death in custody More on the death of a man in Alice Springs: NT police have said that as per their protocol, this is considered a death in custody, and so a senior commissioned officer has been put in charge of the investigation. The spokesperson said: We have had detectives involved in the preliminary investigative process and major crime investigators are flying to Alice Springs this afternoon to assist with the evidence collection in relation to this matter. This matter will be investigated and reported on, on behalf of the coroner and the Northern Territory pathologist is travelling to Alice Springs tomorrow and will conduct an autopsy in relation to the matter. NT police have been speaking in Alice Springs about the death in custody earlier today. The man, identified since the incident as a 24-year-old Aboriginal man from Alice Springs, died this afternoon after being restrained by police at a Coles supermarket. The police spokesperson said: At 1.10 pm this afternoon, there was a report of an incident that occurred in the Coles supermarket in Alice Springs. The incident involved a person who was placing items down the front of their clothing, who was confronted by security guards. There was an altercation that occurred as a consequence of that confrontation. One of the security guards was assaulted and there were two police officers who were in plainclothes at the time in the supermarket, who rendered assistance to the security guards. The male behaved rather aggressively and was placed on to the ground by those police officers. He was later identified as losing consciousness. Other officers and St John Ambulance arrived and the man was taken to the Alice Springs hospital, but died soon afterwards. Larissa Waters: Labor must knock back Woodside North West Gas Shelf extension The Greens leader,Larissa Waters,has urged Labor\u2019sMurray Wattto \u201cknock this mega carbon bomb back\u201d rather than approvingan extension to Woodside\u2019s North West Gas Shelf. Despite Labor going to the election emphasising gas as a \u201ctransition\u201d fuel, Waters told ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing that there was enough gas available in Australia already. Waters said: It is not, in my view, the role of an environment minister to tick off on the country\u2019s biggest dirty gas project that we have ever seen that would lock us into fossil fuel usage out of 2070. Waters said the choice was open to the Labor government to go down a different route rather than allow Woodside to extend its operations, saying \u201cthe public are really watching this and they want to know that this new government will take climate seriously\u201d. Waters was derisive aboutWoodside chief executiveMeg O\u2019Neill\u2019s commentsthat young people were hypocritical because they were \u201cideological\u201d on fossil fuels while \u201chappily ordering from Temu\u201d. Waters said: You can\u2019t make something like that up. Here is a very well-paid, wealthy fossil fuel executive trying to claim with a straight face that the climate crisis is the fault of young people shopping online for goods they can afford in a cost-of-living crisis. So I\u2019m afraid I take her comments with a massive grain of salt.You can\u2019t be the head of a massive dirty gas company and point the finger at other people about the climate crisis. That\u2019s it for me.Stephanie Converywill be on hand to see you through the evening\u2019s news. Aman has died in police custody in Alice Springsafter being restrained when police intervened in an altercation between the man and a security guard at a Coles supermarket. In a statement this afternoon, NT police said they received reports of the altercation at 1.10pm local time. Two police officers were in the store at the time of the incident and restrained the man, the statement said. A short time later, the man \u201cstopped breathing and CPR was commenced\u201d. The man was taken to Alice Springs hospital by St John Ambulance and was pronounced dead just after 2:20pm. A crime scene was established at the shopping centre, which will remain closed, and the incident is being treated as a death in custody. The Northern Territory police force major crime section detectives are travelling to Alice Springs to continue the investigation. Minns says Rosehill effort has changed conversation about housing in Sydney The NSW premier,Chris Minns, said while he would have \u201cloved\u201d to see the Rosehill proposal pass, he believed it was a \u201cfight worth having\u201d. Minns said: I think this would\u2019ve been good for racing and good for Sydney. But rather than throw the car in reverse and say we can\u2019t have big bold ideas any more, I think we\u2019ve got to double down on it.

Chris Minns says Sydney has \u2018missed out\u2019 after Rosehill decision The NSW premier,Chris Minns, says he is disappointed with the result after the Australian Turf Club rejected plans to sell Rosehill racecourse to the state. Minns said: I think it\u2019s an opportunity that Sydney\u2019s missed out on \u2026 This shouldn\u2019t take the wind out of the sails when it comes to bold ideas for housing. We should be taking more risk when it comes to major housing proposals. We\u2019ve been far too timid for far too long.

McGauran said: It\u2019s finished, it\u2019s done \u2026 I am disappointed that the vote wasn\u2019t successful, but I understand that people opposed it. He said the deal would have transformed \u201cthe entire Sydney racing scene for the next 100 years\u201d. McGauran went on to say the ATC remained a strong and viable club, but said it would be more of a challenge going forward as the group would not have the funding a sale would have brought.",

        "raw_text": "Telstra is expecting to shrink its workforce by 2030 with \u201cAI efficiencies\u201d potentially coming through customer service, software development and the use of autonomous AI agents, the company has told investors on Tuesday. The telco\u2019s chief executive, Vicki Brady, told the Telstra\u2019s annual investor day on Tuesday that artificial intelligence \u201cwill be a significant unlock when it comes to enabling our workforce\u201d. \u201cWe will embrace AI, as every business will need to, and we expect the pace of change over the next five years to be extraordinary,\u201d Brady said, flagging it would likely reduce the headcount of Australia\u2019s largest telecommunications company. \u201cWe can\u2019t predict exactly what our business will look like in 2030, but we expect our workforce to be smaller than it is today,\u201d she said. Brady said Telstra had not yet launched agentic AI \u2013 a type of AI that acts autonomously and can perform tasks without human guidance. But she said they were working \u201con a number of things\u201d and she expected Telstra to be talking about agentic AI working alongside Telstra staff in the coming months. It was not expected, for now, for AI agents to be dealing directly with customers. Brady said AI was going to play a big part in Telstra reinventing itself over the next five years. She said after a recent trip to the US, she came away thinking the pace and scale of change happening as a result of AI is \u201cjust phenomenal\u201d. \u201cTwelve months ago, people weren\u2019t really talking about [agentic] agents a whole lot. I think a year ago, people were probably in a conversation about models hallucinating and talking about that,\u201d she said. \u201cActually, 12 months on, that\u2019s not really a conversation any more, because the models have become so much more sophisticated now the conversation is around agents.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Telstra\u2019s chief financial officer, Michael Ackland said the company was \u201cleaning in hard\u201d on artificial intelligence, with the opportunity greatest in customer engagement. \u201cWe spend over $2bn per annum in operating costs across activities from sales to contact centres, activation, billing and customer management. And we think AI will revolutionise these activities,\u201d he said. Telstra has already deployed generative AI in its business, including in its customer service, using AI to summarise customer calls in a task that previously had to be done by staff manually. Brady did not put a number on a future reduction expected by AI. As of December 2024, more than 31,000 full-time equivalent employees work for Telstra Group. Ackland said the more than $1bn of capital expenditure and operating expenditure on software development and IT was another area AI \u201chas the potential to fundamentally change how this is done\u201d. He also flagged having networks able to automatically fix itself or proactively identify network issues before they occur would also save on costs. The Optus CEO Stephen Rue told Guardian Australia last week that AI would have a big role to play in telecommunications. Analysts have warned about companies announcing job cuts as a result of the use of artificial intelligence. After the cybersecurity companyCrowdStrike announced plans earlier this month to cut 5% of its workforceafter identifying AI efficiencies, Aaron McEwan, vice-president of research and advisory at the consulting firm Gartner, said he was sceptical because companies were facing pressure to deliver on big investments made in AI. \u201cThe productivity gains that we expect to see from AI just aren\u2019t flowing through.\u201d Telstra\u2019s comments came at the launch of its Connected Future 30 strategy, outlining the course of the business in the next five years, focused on cost discipline and efficiency across the company. While Telstra may shrink its headcount, the plan stated Telstra aimed to \u201cbe in the top 25% of companies globally for employee engagement\u201d, while also aiming to be in the top 25% of global enterprises in AI maturity by 2030.",

Healthscope, backed by global investment firm Brookfield, had beenrenegotiating its finances with lendersafter accruing $1.6bn in debt and defaulting on various lease payments. The private hospital owner said in a statement that its 37 hospitals would remain open and operating on a business-as-usual basis with no impact on staff, doctors or patient care. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The health minister,Mark Butler, called the development \u201chighly distressing to the patients, staff and local communities that depend on Healthscope\u2019s services\u201d. \u201cWhile Healthscope have announced they will remain operating as normal with no change to patient care or staffing, this will still be difficult for the hospital\u2019s employees and their patients,\u201d Butler said on Monday afternoon. He said the government had met with the administrator and the receiver to outline priorities and expectations, and that he expected \u201call parties to continue to put patient care and workers as their priority\u201d. \u201cAs the government has said all along, there will be no taxpayer bailout,\u201d he said. \u201cWe remain steadfast in our view that an orderly sales process that maintains the integrity of the entire hospital group will provide the best outcome for patients, staff, landlords and lenders.\u201d Restructuring firm McGrathNicol was appointed to sell the business. It was provided with a new $100m funding package by financier Commonwealth Bank to support operations during the sale process. \u201cOur immediate focus is to engage constructively with all key stakeholders to ensure uninterrupted operation of Healthscope hospitals and continuity of best practice standards of patient care,\u201d McGrathNicol partner Keith Crawford said. Receiverships are used by creditors to sell or reorganise assets to recoup debts. Healthscope\u2019s chief executive, Tino La Spina, said on Monday it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d. \u201cThere will be no hospital closures, there will be no redundancies,\u201d he said.

        "raw_text": "\u2018Lewis Capaldi said to me recently: \u2018All I ever wanted was to get my name on the steps at King Tut\u2019s,\u2019\u201d says Judith Atkinson, one half of the couple behind the music venue that has long been where Glaswegians find their new favourite band. Celebrating 35 years this year, King Tut\u2019s Wah Wah Hut was whereOasiswere discovered by Alan McGee and soon signed to his record label Creation. The Verve and Radiohead played in the same two-week period as that gig in 1993, while Manic Street Preachers, Florence + the Machine and entire scenes of Scottish alternative music have got a leg up there since. \u201cWhen I was growing up you didn\u2019t dream about playing Glastonbury \u2013 but you dream about playing King Tut\u2019s, the thing that\u2019s within your reach,\u201d says Scottish singer-songwriterKT Tunstall. \u201cIt\u2019s such a big deal.\u201d Small music venues like this have been in crisis since the pandemic due to rising costs for rent and utilities \u2013 according to the Music Venue Trust, 125 grassroots venues permanently closed in 2023, the worst year on record, followed by another 25 in 2024. And yet, thanks in part to a live music empire the owners have built around it, King Tut\u2019s is thriving, despite only having space for 300 people. Stuart Clumpas, who founded the venue in 1990 alongside his wife Atkinson, reckons it has something to do with Glasgow\u2019s dismal climate. \u201cScotland is an indoor entertainment society because of the weather,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only way to go, \u2018Hey I\u2019m going to go out for a night\u2019 and be guaranteed it\u2019s going to happen and work is to go to something indoors.\u201d He remembers that fabled Oasis night, when the band drove from Manchester to try their luck and play an already-filled support slot. From the bouncer almost not letting them in, to venue staff refusing to let them perform, each story is different. Clumpas sets the record straight: \u201cIt was another support band who said they can\u2019t play, not us,\u201d he says. \u201cThey went, \u2018Fuck off, it\u2019s too small a stage.\u2019 You can\u2019t put three drumkits on the stage the size of King Tut\u2019s.\u201d But Oasis did manage to perform, and the rest is history. Another legendary band would never have been booked, though, if it was up to Atkinson and not venue booker Geoff Ellis. \u201cHe kept booking this band calledRadioheadand they only ever did 150 people,\u201d Atkinson says, \u201cI remember saying to him: \u2018Why do you keep booking that bloody Radiohead, Geoff?\u2019 That\u2019s why I\u2019m not a booker!\u201d But Atkinson\u2019s experience in promoting gigs meant she was well placed to spot local up and coming artists, including future indie legendsBelle and Sebastian. \u201cThey used to come in a lot and hang out,\u201d she says, and the band once struck up an impromptu live set in the pub area below the main venue. \u201cThey were playing Boy With the Arab Strap and the whole pub was sitting at their tables jiggling to this song. I just went: wow, we\u2019re in a scene!\u201d Blur got much shorter shrift. \u201cI do likeBlurnow, I\u2019m very fond of them. But they played King Tut\u2019s when they\u2019d been tipped to be the next big thing. They were so obnoxious because they were on the front cover of all the magazines that week \u2013 they were so full of it. I was only in my mid-20s but I was able to be like, \u2018Guys, you\u2019re going to meet the same people on the way down as the way up.\u2019 They came back and played about six months later and their tail was between their legs. God, they were polite.\u201d When you enter King Tut\u2019s, history surrounds you. Downstairs in the pub the walls are adorned with memorabilia from gigs past, and on the stairs up to the venue each step shows an artist and the year they played. Tunstall has her name painted on the 2005 step next to Simple Minds, Arctic Monkeys and Texas. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely one of the proudest notches on my belt,\u201d she says. That gig was around when her debut album Eye to the Telescope was released \u2013 the next year, she received three Brit nominations, winning for British female solo artist. She reckons the venue\u2019s success comes down to the kind treatment she received from the owners, along with the sound quality. \u201cYour job on stage is to just try and whip up that energy to the point where everybody feels extremely present and connected to each other, and at some venues it\u2019s hard to do that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut at King Tut\u2019s, you\u2019re halfway there already. Thank God they don\u2019t freshly paint it every three years \u2013 it\u2019s like all the energy is kind of soaked into the walls in that place.\u201d Another Scot,Nina Nesbitt, says \u201cit feels like a moment when you go there\u201d to play \u2013 her first time was in 2013, the year before her debut album Peroxide (a Scottish chart topper). \u201cTouring at that [grassroots] level is really difficult mentally and physically,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not really getting much sleep and you\u2019re sitting in dressing rooms with no windows, and it\u2019s quite depressing. The shows are amazing, but everything else is tough. Sometimes you don\u2019t evenhavea dressing room.\u201d But at King Tut\u2019s, \u201cthey really do take care of their artists. They have a lovely little dressing room, I think they have fairy lights in it. Little things go a long way, and put you in a good mood for the show.\u201d General manager Davie Millar says he is still visited by famous faces who have made it big since their King Tut\u2019s debut. Liam Gallagher set the video for his single Come Back to Me at the venue \u2013 Millar has a cameo \u2013 and the 1975 \u201cjust popped in for a drink\u201d recently. \u201cThere\u2019s just a real vibe about the place. Bands like Manic Street Preachers and the Killers who played here many years ago, it\u2019s a real privilege for them to say \u2018yeah, we\u2019d love to come back and play\u2019.\u201d As well as its famous patrons, King Tut\u2019s has benefited from being a small part of a much bigger operation. Clumpas, the founder, and Ellis, the booker, founded Scottish festival T in the Park in 1994 as a joint venture between DF Concerts \u2013 Clumpas\u2019s entertainment business he started in Dundee in the 80s \u2013 and Tennent\u2019s Lager (it later became TRNSMT festival). After Ellis took over as chief executive of DF Concerts in 2001, Live Nation acquired a majority stake in 2008 \u2013 all of which means that King Tut\u2019s has a financial security that is rare for a grassroots venue. It\u2019s also unique in that it doesn\u2019t have outside promoters putting on their own gigs: all the booking are still done in house. Millar clearly sees all that as a privilege, too: \u201cWe\u2019re just going to keep doing what we\u2019re doing: continually finding artists, giving them a platform to be able to create and share their art.\u201d He says the fundamentals won\u2019t change \u2013 \u201cPeople buy tickets because they love coming to live shows\u201d \u2013 so what\u2019s next? \u201cAnother 35 years. I truly believe that.\u201d",

Either way, the latest instalment of the Barbican\u2019s celebrations for the centenary of20th-century musical giant Pierre BoulezfeaturingEnsemble intercontemporain(his own crack team for new music) drew only a paltry audience. The man himself was dismissive of such difficulties: \u201cYou always find 200 fanatics,\u201d he once observed. \u201cWhat is important is to increase the number.\u201d (Composer, conductor, visionary \u2013 but Boulez was no PR maven.) The fanatics, at least, were there \u2013 though they hadn\u2019t come for Boulez himself, if the polite response to a thrillingly anarchic performance of his Sur Incises after the interval was anything to go by. Under rising-star conductorNicol\u00f2 Umberto Foron, its moments of freefall reverberation were a delicious release from the ultra-precise rhythmic flurries of three pianos, thunderous in their lower register. Instead, it was the first half that generated excitement: a taut, intensely focused performance ofshouting forever into the receiver, for which British composerHannah Kendallwon an Ivor Novello award in 2023, followed by the world premiere of composer, saxophonist and bandleaderCassie Kinoshi\u2019s [Untitled]. Kendall\u2019s piece is a haunting exploration of Cuban writer Antonio Ben\u00edtez-Rojo\u2019s concept of the \u201cPlantation Machine\u201d. Much of the finely textured score functions as pitched white noise around crackly walkie-talkie speech in French and English. At its most memorable moment, the orchestral instruments fall silent, leaving only music boxes cranking out extracts of classical hits and harmonicas producing vivid note-clusters on every exhalation like an ethereal musical life-support machine. Kinoshi\u2019s [Untitled] was a noisier, funkier affair, incorporating virtuosic live turntabling byNikNak, whose whirlwind scratches cut deeply across the orchestra\u2019s dense textures, as well as video by French artistJulien Creuzetand solo choreography fromtyroneisaacstuart. Musically, it was exquisitely paced. Momentum gathered through the hefty bass of lower strings, fiendish trumpet curlicues were picked up by a cello screaming high up the fingerboard and two flutes combined in a moreish, barline-defying groove. At the heady climax, the orchestra was suddenly cut, leaving only a symphony of squelches, echoes and loops from the turntable, spinning out overhead.",

        "raw_text": "Rick Derringer, the singer and guitarist who topped the US charts with his band the McCoys and was a sideman for a host of stars including Barbra Streisand, Cyndi Lauper and Steely Dan, has died aged 77. The news was announced in a Facebook post by his close friend Tony Wilson, who did not give a cause of death. While he didn\u2019t achieve household name status, Derringer was one of the great Zelig figures of American pop and rock, in a career stretching back to his mid-teens. Born Richard Zehringer in Ohio, he and his family moved to Union City, Indiana, where he formed garage rockers the McCoys. They got the chance to record their own version of the rhythm and blues song My Girl Sloopy, with a 17-year-old Derringer as frontman \u2013 renamed Hang on Sloopy, it reached No 1 in the US in 1965. After Ohio State University\u2019s marching band started playing it at college football games, it got another boost in popularity and eventually, in 1985, Ohio designated it the state\u2019s official rock song. The McCoys had another US Top 10 hit with the follow-up, a cover of Little Willie John\u2019s Fever. Come On, Let\u2019s Go reached No 22 the following year and the group recorded five albums together. The McCoys then partnered with blues rocker Johnny Winter for the group Johnny Winter And, who made the first recording of another Derringer rock classic: Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo. The definitive version came in 1973, performed by Derringer for his debut solo album All American Boy. This raunchy and swaggering hard-rock track reached No 23 in the US, and later earned high-profile syncs on the soundtracks to Richard Linklater film Dazed and Confused and the fourth season of Stranger Things. Also in 1973, Derringer returned to the top of the US charts thanks to his production and guitar playing for the Edgar Winter Group (fronted by the brother of Johnny Winter), on the hard-rocking instrumental Frankenstein. He also contributed to their No 14 hit Free Ride the same year. Derringer continued to release studio albums, eventually numbering 14 in all, but his most high-profile work came as a guitarist and producer for others. By 1973 he\u2019d already played on a couple of songs on Alice Cooper\u2019s 1971 album Killer, and begun a fruitful partnership with Todd Rundgren, appearing on a number of his albums over the years. He later played on the Steely Dan albums Countdown to Ecstasy, Katy Lied and Gaucho, and, in collaboration with Jim Steinman, two of the biggest power ballads of the 1980s: Air Supply\u2019s Making Love Out of Nothing at All and Bonnie Tyler\u2019s Total Eclipse of the Heart. Derringer went on to work with another Steinman acolyte, Meat Loaf, on the album Blind Before I Stop and the TV show Way Off Broadway, and played lead guitar on the Steinman-penned Left in the Dark, the lead single from Barbra Streisand\u2019s 1984 album Emotion. Another repeat collaborator was \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic, including on his Grammy-winning Michael Jackson spoof Eat It. More cheerfully silly work was in the world of American wrestling, with Derringer writing Hulk Hogan\u2019s theme song Real American and producing tie-in albums for the World Wrestling Federation. The 1980s and 90s brought a partnership with Cyndi Lauper \u2013 Derringer played on her album True Colours and A Night to Remember, and joined her touring band. He later went on three world tours with Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band, and recorded albums with his wife Jenda, including one with their children Lory and Marn. Derringer continued to tour throughout his life, and his most recent album Rock the Yacht, another collaboration with Jenda, was released in 2023.",

        "raw_text": "\u2018You need to listen to this,\u201d said my friend Helen over her birthday lunch in 2018. \u201cHave you ever heard ofK-pop?\u201d I hadn\u2019t \u2013 I didn\u2019t know it was short for Korean pop music, or about K-pop \u201cidols\u201d (stars). She played me songs by the South Korean boyband SHINee and I was instantly captivated. It reminded me of the pop music I loved in the 00s, when I was growing up: the bombastic music videos, the repetitive electro-pop hooks, the bands where each member has a distinct role, like a family. It was pure escapism. Gradually, I started listening to more and more K-pop, until I took the plunge and did something I\u2019d previously dismissed as \u201ccringe\u201d. With my twin sister, Hannah, I went to a K-pop-themed \u201ccafe event\u201d at the Gaza cafe in Soho, London. The get-together marked the birthdays of three members of the boyband GOT7. Their music videos played on TV screens and their album sleeves were displayed on the stairwell walls. Mounds of bingsoo \u2013 a Korean shaved-ice dessert \u2013 were served. I was surprised to find that the cafe event drew a relatively mixed crowd \u2013 including other Black girls, like me. I\u2019d expected to stick out and felt apprehensive that I might leave feeling ostracised from a scene I\u2019d come to adore. But everyone was friendly and welcoming, and we quickly bonded over our shared \u2013 albeit niche \u2013 interest. Growing up, I was often preoccupied by what other people thought of me; here, no one seemed to care. As a teenager, I often felt I stood out, despite my best efforts to blend in. By the time I reached my 20s, I was an overweight, dark-skinned \u201cfour-eyes\u201d, and acutely aware of it. As a result, I did everything I could to make myself seem smaller: I wore dark clothes, pinned every strand of my afro hair flat to my head and hardly spoke at work. Yet at the K-pop party, Black girls wore bright makeup, band T-shirts and big smiles as they shared homemade photocards (trading cards, a little like football stickers), swapped badges and squealed when their favourite tracks were played. From there, my K-pop obsession began to snowball. I started listening to boybands such as MONSTA X, BTS and EXO, then girl groups such as Mamamoo and Dreamcatcher. Helen and I, friends since secondary school, launched a K-pop podcast called UK-pop (get it?). The fashion rubbed off on me too: black clothes stopped dominating my wardrobe as I added a red mohair scarf here, a Lucozade-orange balaclava there; I even bought a bomber jacket with pink flamingos all over it. I got silver braids in my hair and wore all my ear piercings at once \u2013 something I\u2019d previously avoided, in case it looked \u201ctoo much\u201d. I spent more than \u00a3400 on concerts, including a \u00a3160 ticket to see GOT7 at Wembley Arena which included \u201chi-touch\u201d, where you high-five the group on the way out of the venue (I can distinctly remember my cologne-scented palm afterwards). Being a K-pop fan bled into my then job as a journalist; I interviewed idols and reviewed concerts. Other Black women who were into K-pop contacted me on social media, including Tasha and Shari, who became good friends offline. With my sister and Helen, we all began meeting up regularly to discuss the latest K-pop news, gigs we\u2019d been to and idol scandals. We went for food at Korean barbecue restaurants, and went to K-pop exhibitions, films and festivals. I had finally found my tribe, a group of friends I could message day or night about anything \u2013 not just K-pop \u2013 and feel completely supported. In the decade since I first encountered K-pop culture, we\u2019ve remained a tight-knit group, encouraging each other through new jobs, moving houses, family bereavements and many other big life decisions. We plan to visit Seoul together in the next couple of years \u2013 my last visit was in 2019, where my sister and I spent an afternoon going to see the headquarters of K-pop labels including SM Entertainment and JYP. Although my K-pop obsession isn\u2019t as intense as it was, an ATEEZ concert in January reminded me of why I fell in love with it so hard. Yes, I enjoy the music, but it\u2019s also down to the warm, funny people K-pop has brought into my orbit, close friends who have encouraged me to let my guard down. I\u2019m now in my 30s and I still aspire to be more like the carefree girls in bright makeup I met at the Gaza cafe all those years ago. I\u2019ve learned that people are not nearly as judgmental as I once feared \u2013 and if they are, so what? As K-pop megastars BTS would say: you can\u2019t stop me loving myself.",

        "raw_text": "The federal sex-trafficking trial ofSean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combsresumed on Tuesday, with his former employee testifying that the music mogul repeatedly threatened her and once forced her to accompany him to the home of rapper Scott Mescudi, known as Kid Cudi, who Combs allegedly said he was going to \u201ckill\u201d. Combs, 55,is facing charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs wasarrested in September 2024and has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. On Tuesday, the prosecution called Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Combs, to the witness stand. Clark, who started working for Combs as a personal assistant in 2004, said that on her first day on the job, Combs became enraged upon learning that she had once worked for his rival, the record producer Suge Knight. Clark testified that Combs told her that \u201cif anything happened he would have to kill me\u201d, she said. Clark also described another time where she was subjected to five days of lie-detector tests after three pieces of jewelry went missing. She said that she was taken by a bodyguard working for Combs to a locked vacant Manhattan office space each day where an unnamed man wouldadminister the tests and told her that if she failed, \u201cthey\u2019re going to throw you in the East River\u201d. Clark testified that she left the job in 2006, after she said Combs physically pushed her after he heard that she had told another employee that she was dissatisfied with her job. She later returned to work for Combs. The prosecutionasked Clark about what happened when Combs discovered in December 2011 that his on-again, off-again girlfriend \u2013 the singer Casandra \u201cCassie\u201d Ventura \u2013 was dating the rapper Scott Mescudi, better known as Kid Cudi. Clark testified that Combs showed up at her house, \u201cfurious\u201d with a gun in his hand, and asked her why she hadn\u2019t told him about the relationship between Ventura and Mescudi. Clark alleged that Combs, while holding the gun, then kidnapped her to go to Mescudi\u2019s house with him, allegedly telling her: \u201cGet dressed, we\u2019re going to go kill\u201d Mescudi, despite her protesting. (Combs\u2019s lawyers have denied that Clark was kidnapped.) Clark claimed that she was then made to get into a car with Combs. One of his security guards was driving, and there was a gun in Combs\u2019s lap, Clark said. When they got to Mescudi\u2019s house, Mescudi was not home. Clark testified that Combs and his security guardentered while she stayed in the car and called Ventura on a disposable cellphone to tell her what was happening. When Combs returned, Clark says that he directed her to call Ventura and to say that he would not release Clark until Ventura came. Ventura was picked up, and they returned to Combs\u2019s home, where Combs allegedly told them not to speak to the police. He also allegedly said that they needed to get Mescudi to not tell the police he was involved. Clark also testified that she witnessed Combs kick and beat Ventura when she arrived at his home that day. Clark told the court that she was fired in 2012. And she said that, after she was terminated, Combs allegedly told her that she would \u201cnever work again\u201d. He also told her that \u201call these people weren\u2019t my friends and he would make me kill myself\u201d, Clark recalled. Clark said she laterreceived a settlement from Combs\u2019s attorneys over allegations of wrongful termination. In 2016, Clark said she returned to work for Combs as Ventura\u2019s creative director, explaining that she had struggled to find other employment. She testified that Combs had final approval over everything when it came to Ventura\u2019s career. During cross-examination, Combs\u2019s lawyer emphasized Clark\u2019s repeated returns to work for Combs over the years, pointing out that even as recently last year, after federal investigators had already begun investigating Combs, Clark met with his legal team and expressed interest in working as his chief of staff. Combs\u2019s lawyer also challenged the kidnapping allegations, suggesting that Clark voluntarily accompanied Combs to Mescudi\u2019s home in December 2011 in an attempt to prevent her boss from doing \u201csomething stupid\u201d. The defense lawyer claimed that Clark had told Combs\u2019s lawyers this during the meeting with Combs\u2019s attorneys last year. Clark responded that she did not recall making that comment and insisted that she did not want to accompany Combs that day. Clark\u2019s testimony wrapped just after 3.30pm ET on Tuesday and the court adjourned for the day. Prosecutors plan to call four witnesses on Wednesday. Clark\u2019s testimony came after Mescuditook the standlast week and alleged that Combs broke into his home in 2011 after learning about his brief relationship with Ventura. Mescudi told the court how, a few weeks after the apparent break-in, his car was set on fire with a molotov cocktail, and that he believed Combs was responsible. Combs and his lawyers have denied the allegation. To date, more than 15 witnesses have testified so far in this trial. In addition to Mescudi, witnesses have includedsinger Dawn Richard,two of Combs\u2019s formerassistants,Ventura\u2019s former best friend,Ventura\u2019s mother, anexotic dancer, amale revue manager,a hotel security officer,a special agent from Homeland Security Investigations(HSI), aforensic psychologist, amakeup artist who worked with Combs and Ventura, thegeneral manager of a Beverly Hills hotel, and acomputer forensics agentfrom HSI. Ventura, the prosecution\u2019s key witness, spent four days on the stand detailingyears of physical and emotional abuse she says she endured by Combsduring their 11-year on-again, off-again relationship. She testified that Combs orchestrated and directed drug-fueled sex performances with male sex workers \u2013 encounters that he referred to as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d. She also testified that hecoerced and blackmailedher into participating. Attorneys for Combs have tried to undermine Ventura\u2019s credibility and have sought to portray her as a willing and consenting participant in the freak-offs. The trial is expected to continue for about six more weeks. If convicted, Combs could spend the rest of his life in prison.

        "raw_text": "Kylie Minogue\u2019s currentTension tour is a glorious spectacle. Dancers prowl around geometric staircases in weird hats, which feels delightfully Pet Shop Boys. There is a disco ball big enough to permanently dazzle every audience member. One visual shows a noirish film of Ms Minogue as a sort of heartbreak-vanquishing detective; a billboard in her rainy street scene incorporates the location of each tour date to ask: \u201cFeeling lonely in Sheffield? Call Kylie \u2026\u201d And there she is in the middle of it all, resplendent in blue PVC; a spangly red jumpsuit; a kaftan-ish thing sewn together from what looks like neon police tape, emblazoned with the classic jagged Kylie heartbeat monitor logo. Kylie is one of our most generous performers: not above adding The Loco-Motion to the setlist following audience demand, its youthful silliness contrasted with Dancing, a gorgeous disco-country song about mortality. The expansiveness of the show made it all the more galling to be forced to partially witness it through the digital camera of the man sitting next to me, who spentthe entire gig\u2013 and I meanevery single second of it\u2013 training his priapic lens on Kylie through wobbly 10x zoom. Everyone has their phone out at gigs now, particularly big pop shows: it\u2019s an unavoidable fact of live music. To look down from our side-stalls seats at any point during the show was to see a glittering of little rectangles, and that\u2019s fine. Teenagers often get the blame for this, but Kylie\u2019s is a fairly middle-aged crowd. I\u2019m not immune either \u2013 I usually limit myself to a single gig pic, just so the event lives in my camera roll, but I took maybe a dozen of all the exciting set pieces. But there is something profoundly creepy about Digital Camera Guy, a fixture of most gigs that feature a female performer. I\u2019ve stood next to this \u2013 always middle-aged or older \u2013 man dozens of times, watching him maintain a shakily tight focus on the women on stage with his ancient silver Olympus, and wondering what on earth he\u2019s going to do with those photos and footage later. Whether his intentions are sleazy or simply trainspottery, his ceaseless scrutiny feels unsettling for female and gender-nonconforming audience members and musicians. As performers in a paid-for, public setting, they\u2019re obviously there to be looked at, but there\u2019s a difference between a reciprocal exchange with an understanding and respectful audience, and feeling monitored. The inference is that women only exist here to be surveilled, perceived as visual stimuli at best, sex objects at worst. It\u2019s bad enough realising that someone is staring at you creepily in public \u2013 behaviour that has been prohibited on London\u2019s public transport network since 2022 \u2013 let alone, I imagine, noticing yourself being watched so intently when you\u2019re trying to stage a show on your own terms. In this dynamic, it\u2019s the performer who generally commands the room, but the perpetually invasive lens undermines that power, reminding them that they\u2019re nothing but an object to be captured. I\u2019ve spoken to plenty of female performers, some of them distressingly young, who hate the sight of DCG but feel they can\u2019t speak out about him for fear of alienating paying fans or being perceived as ungrateful, uppity bitches. I\u2019ve also spoken to several of my own male friends in their 40s and 50s who worry about being tarred with the same brush, who fear going to gigs alone or standing anywhere near the front in case they\u2019re perceived as pervs who haven\u2019t come to listen to the music. In case you think I\u2019m overstating this, one of those friends texted me saying he\u2019d stood next to a DCG atWet Legin London this weekend, and watched in horror as the man kept unabashedly zooming in on the band\u2019s legs and bums. I\u2019m sure most DCGs are not taking photos to get off to later (you\u2019d have a job, through all the pixels). But either way, the lack of self-awareness makes so many other people in the crowd profoundly uncomfortable, leading them to question their entirely equal place in this environment. I felt icky every time I accidentally brushed the guy sitting next to me on Friday. I\u2019ve had Kylie\u2019s rapturous encore closer Love at First Sight as an earworm since then, but that feeling of unease is the thing I really can\u2019t get out of my head. DCG: I beg you, stop it.",

Even the singer\u2019s opening gambit Try Me throws up a challenge: \u201cI say your mind\u2019s made up on me,\u201d she sighs, her voice silky. The Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more. This is Smith\u2019s first UK tour since 2018, when, at just 21, her raw, atmospheric debut album won Grammy and Mercury nominations, Brit awards and a host of celebrity fans. Glitzy features with Drake, Stormzy and Burna Boy followed, but otherwise Smith resisted the playbook for sudden fame. She left London for home town Walsall, spent five years on her follow-up album, 2023\u2019s pointedly titled Falling or Flying, and only now, another two years later, is she touring those songs. Her searing, smoky voice is used sparingly to start, sometimes even drowned out by the power of the band\u2019s two drummers. But by Feelings, a duet with rapper J Hus whose verses are covered well by a backing singer, Smith drops the wall. She beams mega-watt charisma through the track\u2019s lyrically chilly push-and-pull, and slinks between risers, glamorously at ease. Falling or Flying expanded her sonic palette with serrated guitar, unusual textures, and a theatrical sense of scale. Tonight even her older tracks benefit from this new ambition. Backing singers bring lush, Solange-esque harmonies to a reimagined version of February 3rd, and there\u2019s a rich, bassy funk to Where Did I Go? The double-drummers inject pure adrenaline into Go Go Go, a rock track with a new wave swing that seems to unlock something in Smith: the intensity suits her. By now, those belting vocals are bringing the room closer, rather than holding the audience at a distance, and when Smith\u2019s singers join her centre stage for a closing run through her poppier, non-album singles such as flirty Be Honest and straight-talking bassline hit Little Things, it feels like a house party instead of a point to prove. Shining and loose, Smith coos to the front rows. \u201cI won\u2019t leave it so long next time,\u201d she promises, with the confidence of a star who knows she can have this whenever she chooses.

        "raw_text": "When I arrive at a gathering I tend to announce my departure in the same breath as my greeting. \u201cHi! I brought some wine, where do you want it? Just letting you know I can only stay an hour because I start work really early on Sunday mornings.\u201d Then I might throw in a little yawn and stretch. Restaurants aren\u2019t much different: my leg\u2019s likely to be jiggling before the order has been jotted down. The last mouthful of dessert sounds a last-drinks bell in my head. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t love my friends. I\u2019ve just got a window of tolerance for face-to-face activities, and then the agitation kicks in.I\u2019ve been so fascinated by social reluctance that I wrote a book exploring it,The Introvert\u2019s Guide to Leaving the House. In my 30s, I\u2019d embarked on a five-year mission to become more outgoing, figuring out which situations I could be comfortable in, and setting myself exercises in social etiquette, empathy and positive reframing. These techniques became second nature by the time I hit my 40s, so I decided to share what I\u2019d learned. It seems timely. When discussing the book with non-introverts, I realised that social overwhelm has massively broadened in recent years. Whether you blame lockdowns, news-cycle malaise or digital-era disconnect, we\u2019re less likely to commit to an outing. But I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s possible to engineer low-key hangs that charge an introvert\u2019s social battery \u2013 or at least don\u2019t drain it as quickly. The three-second rule doesn\u2019t just apply to dropped food. As reported by theBritish Psychological Society, a 2016 study of nearly 500 participants found the vast majority felt most comfortable with eye contact that lasted just over three seconds. Business blogs fromThroughline GrouptoIncwill tell you that\u2019s the optimal eye gaze time because you\u2019re showing engagement without becoming unnerving. That\u2019s why shoulder-to-shoulder activities are such a relief. These are activities we do alongside each other rather than face to face, such as going to a gallery, playing pool, a games night, joining your local chapter of theSilent Book Clubor taking a simple walk \u2013 cheapest hangout ever. Men tend to naturally go shoulder to shoulder more than women; in fact, the Australian Men\u2019s Shed Association slogan is \u201cMen don\u2019t talk face to face, but shoulder to shoulder\u201d. I prefer to know in advance how many people are coming. A newish friend once suggested we go on holiday overseas. I agreed, we made an itinerary, then she announced that another woman, who I didn\u2019t know, would be joining us. \u201cThe more the merrier!\u201d said the friend. Worst holiday ever. The maths is simple: the more bodies there are in a social pile-up, the more overwhelming it becomes. A single person is possible to read. A scenario with two people requires split concentration to accommodate them both. More than two people means second-guessing what everyone is thinking, so knowing what is most appropriate to say is absolutely impossible. It can help to know who\u2019s coming in order to take a moment beforehand to recall the last time you met each person and what was going on for them. Having a one to one side-conversation with someone about something that interests them is infinitely better than aimless group small talk. You could even make notes in your phone contacts whenever you\u2019ve had an interesting chat. It\u2019s not stalking, it\u2019s anthropology \u2013 you\u2019re studying your community. What if you don\u2019t know the people? I like to gamify a situation I\u2019m not looking forward to. In this scenario the game could be: figure out who in this group could potentially be your new BFF. Find common ground. Many introverts take the scraping of chair legs across a cafe floor extremely personally. We\u2019re sensitive to loud, unscheduled noises (at kids\u2019 parties, balloons were a nightmare for me), so venues with the acoustics of a concrete cube are best avoided lest we fritz our synapses. For anyone with sensory processing issues or simply of an irritable nature, a table of six people talking at once sounds like a beer hall during Oktoberfest. Worse, there\u2019s probably going to be cross-talk, where more than one conversation is competing for our brain\u2019s attention. In these social gatherings I often fall silent. People must think I have the consumptive constitution of a 19th-century muse. If it\u2019s just you and a friend, you could likely get away with suggesting a venue change because you\u2019re dying to hang on to their every word but can\u2019t hear them. If it\u2019s a larger group you could try wearable tech \u2013 the fancy term for earplugs. Brands such as Happy Ears, Earjobs or Loop earplugs reduce background noise while still allowing conversation to cut through. Every year I fly back to the UK for a week-long family holiday by the seaside, but despite wanting to see my family, I find being fully present during this intensive period a real struggle. After each trip my cousin Adam posts a big album of photos to Facebook. Without fail I\u2019m only in about two photographs, because all week I\u2019ve been \u201cjust going back to the house\u201d, \u201cjust off to get something\u201d or giving them a head start to the beach hut and promising to catch up. Eventually. One year, I decided I would consciously opt to skip certain activities and fully participate in others. Of course, I chose to commit to shoulder-to-shoulder activities. For instance, I opted out of sitting and chatting in the beach hut, but committed to a board game in the evening.Think of the next lengthy get-together you\u2019ve got coming up and consider what elements you\u2019ll sit out and what you\u2019ll commit to. Then make sure you\u2019re in the photos. Now you\u2019ve committed to a hangout, give yourself time to self-regulate, since your mood has an effect on others. That means no sighing on arrival or being distant. Introverts can find it harder than most to communicate what\u2019s going on for us, but developmentally, managing our spillage is something we ought to be on top of by the time we leave school. If we\u2019re still killing everyone\u2019s buzz as adults, then it\u2019s something we\u2019ve given ourselves permission to do, hoping people will just make allowances. If your modus operandi has always been Wallow Now, Apologise Later, a good way to behaviour-check yourself is to ask: am I likely to send an apologetic text to this person later? If the answer is yes, try to tackle your behaviour in the moment instead. You might acknowledge your mood and say you\u2019re going to reset. You could even half-jokingly ask the other person to help you out by giving you an update on their news while you\u2019re \u201crebooting\u201d. Better still, take a few minutesbeforea meet-up to focus on your positive relationship with the person and what might be going on in their life. Ultimately, the best way to get out of your own head is to consider another person\u2019s needs.

Turn down the heat to medium-low, gently lower the eggs into the water and set a timer for six minutes. While the eggs cook, prepare a bowl of iced water. When the timer goes off, immediately remove the eggs from the pan and leave in the iced water. Heat the oil in a wok or large saucepan over medium heat. Add the curry paste, garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, for two minutes. Add the coconut milk, stock, soy sauce and sugar and bring to a simmer. Add the tofu puffs, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for five minutes to develop the flavours. While the laksa cooks, prepare the noodles, following packet directions, then drain and set aside. Peel and halve the eggs. Add the bok choy to the laksa broth then cook for three to four minutes, until the stems are just tender. Spoon the noodles and bok choy into four bowls. Stir the lime juice into the broth, thenladle laksa into the bowls, sharing the tofu puffs evenly among them. Top each bowl with two egg halves, sliced green onions, coriander leaves and sliced chilli if using. You can store leftovers in the fridge for up to three days. Reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave. This is an edited extract fromMoney-Saving Meal Plans with Chelseaby Chelsea Goodwin, photography by Melissa Darr (Penguin, A$36.99)",

        "raw_text": "\u201cWe offer 15,000 whites. Pick any three.\u201d I more often give this advice to female clients, since in 40 years restoring, colour-matching and consulting I\u2019ve seen most domestic decor decisions made by women. Apart from any cultural aspect, studies of human biology suggest a reason: only one in 200 women is colour-blind compared with one in 10 men (even more, I suspect, are partially afflicted). Tetrachromacy \u2013 the ability to see a far broader range of colours \u2013 is also only found in females. This innate ability to define hues accurately doesn\u2019t stop some women favouring odd colour schemes, I\u2019ve found. I once matched paint to a Melbourne Storm jersey \u2013 deep purple, black and bright yellow \u2013 for the house and fences of a rugby fan. She showed me the result. I hoped the neighbours liked it; I didn\u2019t. One like-minded young man had me turn the walls and ceiling of hisboydoirvampire-violet to match the satin sheets on his circular bed. \u201cThe ladies really go for it,\u201d he later told me, proudly displaying the image of a claustrophobic bat cave, complete with bile-yellow lava lamps. Of course, these clients are outliers. Most choose subtle hues and wall colours that better reflect light and visually enlarge spaces. But with so much choice, colour schemes can be complex. I\u2019ve known some people who find choosing colours excruciating. This can include industry professionals. I worked with one notoriously finicky decorator who insisted our restoration team match entire walls to one fingernail-size spot on an 18th-century table. It wasn\u2019t possible, and we told her so, but she insisted, and the result wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d hoped for. This pressure for perfection was evident when I prepared paint and offered advice for The Block contestants in 2023. The show revealed that taste, decorating talent and stamina are not equally distributed, and I often shared the stress, especially when asked to match a deep-green bathroom tile for a frantic participant. The tile\u2019s texture made our $12,000 German colour-matching device useless, so it was down to my eyes. I finally got it \u2013 but only after 11 steps, cautiously approaching the desired shade with tiny increments of valuable pigment to avoid overshooting and having to backtrack or, worse, producing a wasteful mis-tint. My abilities meet their match when it comes to render. When restoring this widely used, problematic surface coating, I\u2019ve found it\u2019s best not to touch up but to repaint entirely. Render\u2019s rough texture prevents accurate machine matching, and its micro shadowing means the identical colour from a flat surface won\u2019t appear the same. As for matching that Block favourite, Venetian plaster, which is variable in colour across broad areas due to its depth and transparency, forget about it. I was also forced to point out that matching from a phone image is never wise. When it comes to accuracy, digital still lags far behind reality. To reduce the stress of TMC (too much choice) I recommend initially picking just three whites for walls. Most paint companies help by featuring a limited range of \u201cpopular\u201d whites, covering the three primary colours in the visible spectrum. These \u201cwhites\u201d contain combinations of pigments leaning towards blue (cool), red (warm) or green (neutral). When choosing samples, it helps to keep a \u201cpure\u201d vivid-white swatch as a reference, and fan your shortlisted colours out across one another to distinguish their slight differences. If you prefer a particular colour, ask your decorator or paint mixer to identify the pigments in a formula, or even to combine them without a base to reveal the fundamental hue before it\u2019s \u201cwhited\u201d out. Of course, decor colour is influenced by light, and today\u2019s LEDs offer more wavelength range than the warm white of superseded incandescent bulbs. So it\u2019s a good idea to test swatches or sample pots in natural and artificial light before deciding. It\u2019s important outside too. I\u2019ve seen many people unhappy with an exterior grey that turned a shade of puce in afternoon or morning sunlight. Unless you like puce (it originally emulated bloodstains from squashed bugs on French bedsheets) I recommend choosing a neutral, green-based grey. Like whites, most greys (which I find are the hardest colours to match) can be steered in the same three spectrum directions by different proportions of blue-based black, with red and yellow ochre. One of my more unwelcome pieces of advice challenges expectant parents\u2019 \u201cnesting instinct\u201d \u2013 the urge to redecorate before the big event. I discourage this for two reasons: it\u2019s stressful; and most paint is toxic. If I can\u2019t persuade the client to postpone the project, I recommend a low VOC product (never oil-based enamels), thoroughly ventilating, staying hydrated (paint\u2019s dryers and oxidants desiccate humans too), and using an activated carbon respirator \u2013 or just getting a non-pregnant partner or painter to do the job. Though painting is painstaking and potentially hazardous work, there\u2019s a kind of meditative fun to be had colouring your world, experimenting with the endless permutations available and then beholding the results \u2013 fresh, clean, vibrant spaces that demonstrate your individuality and sense of good taste. Unless you choose puce, that is.",

        "raw_text": "It was Christmas Eve, 1977. I was 20 years old and working on the desk at a credit union as a teller. Management thought it was a wise idea to offer our customers a glass of champagne with their withdrawals that day, so I had been helping myself to a small glass of bubbly as I handed the customers one. By the end of the day I was unsurprisingly a bit tipsy and, when I balanced up the till, I realised I was $20 short. At the time, $20 was almost a week\u2019s pay for me, or at least half a week\u2019s pay, so it was a decent amount of money. I was sitting there feeling quite distressed, because if the till was down you had to make it up from your own wages \u2013 that was the deal. It meant I would have no money for the Christmas period. Suddenly there was a knock on the window, and I looked up to see a man who seemed desperate to come in. We normally didn\u2019t let anyone in after we\u2019d closed but the man kept knocking, so I eventually opened the door a crack to see what he wanted. When I did, he handed me the missing $20 note \u2013 he told me I\u2019d overpaid him, so he\u2019d spent half an hour travelling across town on Christmas Eve to return the money, knowing that my till would be out. It was a lovely thing to do, and it made a lot of difference to my outlook on life. It wasn\u2019t just the money, it was the fact that he had gone to such effort to make sure that I wasn\u2019t out of pocket, when it was entirely my fault anyway. The experience also meant that I\u2019d never accept an accidental overpayment from anyone ever again. I know how much that money can matter to people working in retail. And I think if you\u2019ve ever worked in the lowest end of jobs, you tend to have more empathy. It\u2019s been almost 50 years but I\u2019ve not forgotten that man\u2019s act of kindness.

        "raw_text": "In September 2022 my brother was murdered. A couple of months later my relationship of six years broke down. That summer was the darkest period of my adult life. It felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me and I was self soothing in ways that I\u2019m not proud of. My mental health was spiralling. My morals were out the door and I hardly recognised myself. By the next April things were turning around. I was seeing a therapist and working on getting my mental and physical health back. It was around this time I was out partying one night at the gay club, Universal, on Oxford Street in Sydney. I was letting my hair down, having a hell of a time, when the sea of people on the dancefloor parted and saw this beautiful Latino guy. I stopped in my tracks, suddenly, he was all I could see. When we locked eyes for what couldn\u2019t have been for more than a few seconds, it felt like a lifetime. We chatted later that night and over the coming months got to know each other as friends. By the springtime romance had blossomed. I was learning more about him and while he was strikingly attractive and extremely fun to be around, on a deeper level I started to realise just how much respect I had for him as a person. He\u2019d arrived from Colombia six years earlier, without a word of English and no family or friends. What he\u2019d been through before coming to Australia and what he\u2019d achieved since was awe-inspiring to me. This kind of deep admiration certainly wasn\u2019t a hallmark of previous relationships I\u2019d had. As the year came to end we still weren\u2019t official but we decided to take a holiday to Bali together. On the day we were due to leave I was turned away at the airport thanks to a tiny tear in my passport. We decided Danny should go on without me. It seemed like the universe was putting the brakes on, but I decided to go home and rebook my ticket. I put on a disguise, went back to the airport and made it through customs. I surprised him in Bali eight hours later. We got our new year\u2019s kiss and cemented ourselves as a couple. As romantic as that moment was, it was a conversation a few months later that confirmed my love for him absolutely. One thing that was obvious about Danny right from the start was how compassionate he is. He perceives human frailty in a way most of us can only aspire to. In my own life, I was carrying a lot of anger about my upbringing and the impact my mother\u2019s struggles with alcoholism and addiction had on me. Our relationship was fraught and as much as I loved her, my judgment and disappointment was palpable every time I saw her. It was horrible for everyone. One day as I complained to Danny about how difficult this all felt for me, how unfair it seemed and how taxing it was, he looked at me warmly and gently asked: \u201cWell how do you think she feels?\u201d When I asked him to explain, he reminded me to count my blessings and remember what my mother had lost throughout it all. Maybe what your mother needs is your love, not your judgment, he said. This knocked me for six. It was such a mature, heartfelt, sincere response. I\u2019d never had anyone frame it that way for me. His tender perspective allowed me to see for the first time how much my mum had suffered too. I knew then what I needed to do to shift the patterns we were entrenched in. It changed everything. The wisdom and kindness he showed in that situation just blew me away. And it was brave of him too, I could have taken it really badly, but in that instant I knew that he was the one. I could see then and there that whatever we faced in life together he would always be there to show empathy, reserve judgment and take me to higher ground. Anytime I\u2019m faced with a dilemma, he\u2019s the first person I turn to. He\u2019s shown me time and time again how deep his integrity runs and that he has my best interests at heart. I never really had good role models like that around me. So, as much as he\u2019s my partner, more than that, he\u2019s an inspiration too.

        "raw_text": "NSW could be on the brink of back-to-back State of Origin series wins after its forwards set the platform for a historic 18-6 win at Suncorp Stadium. The Blues dominated Queensland on Wednesday night, with only missed conversions from all four tries stopping the scoreline from blowing out. After winning last year\u2019s decider in Brisbane, the victory marked the first time the Blues have breached the Suncorp fortress in successive games in 27 years. NSW have also now won three straight games for the first time in 19 years, after coming back from 1-0 down in last year\u2019s series. But of most importance to the Blues is they can win this year\u2019s series in Perth on June 18, with another chance in Sydney three weeks later. \u201cAny time you can come here and win you\u2019ve got to be happy, so extremely happy,\u201d Blues coach Laurie Daley said. \u201cBut it\u2019s only camp one. We\u2019ll see what [Queensland] are like when they bounce into game two. \u201cBecause one thing I know about Origin is there\u2019s always a response. You get hit in the face, there\u2019s a response next game.\u201d Maroons five-eighth Cameron Munster said Queensland needed to \u201cplay smarter\u201d. \u201cWe played some dumb footy and gave them too many opportunities,\u201d he told the Nine Network. For all its dominance, NSW was still made to sweat for its win. After leading 14-0 just before the break, it lost Brian To\u2019o to the sin-bin on the stroke of halftime when he tackled Xavier Coates in midair as the Maroons winger attempted to plant a try. There was no penalty try but it did leave the Blues exposed at the start of the second half. They looked up to the task when six men bundled Valentine Holmes into touch. But from the next play Coates scored, Jeremiah Nanai\u2019s pinpoint hit on Latrell Mitchell sending the ball loose and the Maroons pouncing. At 14-6 it was still anyone\u2019s game, both sides error-riddled under fatigue as the quality descended. Two-try hero Zac Lomax and Connor Watson combined to produce the moment, both somehow popping offloads in tackles allowing Dylan Edwards to score the clincher with eight minutes to play. Halves Mitchell Moses and Nathan Cleary clicked in their partnership debut for NSW while Stephen Crichton shrugged off his early-week injury crisis. Mitchell was also immense in his Origin return at centre. That was all made possible by a dominant Blues pack, with man-of-the-match Payne Haas topping 150 metres after barely training on a quad tear in the build up. \u201cFor a big bloke and limited prep to jump out of the ground and do what he did was inspirational,\u201d Daley said. The Blues\u2019 go-forward quietened the capacity crowd in the first half, with the Maroons giving away three ruck penalties inside the first 10 minutes to gift the visitors field position. Harry Grant was ineffective at hooker while Pat Carrigan missed five tackles and had the Maroons pack\u2019s only tackle break at half-time, compared to 12 from the Blues forwards. \u201cThey were much better than us. I feel pretty flat to be honest about our performance,\u201d Queensland coach Billy Slater said. \u201cThe flatness comes from how we hurt ourselves. Very ill-disciplined in the first half, and then that just snowballed against us.\u201d Queensland has scored just one try in their last two games at Suncorp, with that coming when the Blues were down a man on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s not good. That\u2019s not a good stat,\u201d Slater said. \u201cProbably as disappointing as the performance tonight.\u201d NSW\u2019s dominance didn\u2019t show on the scoreboard until later in the half on Wednesday, with Haas breaking the line and offloading before Lomax scored. To\u2019o crossed four minutes later, Mitchell\u2019s brilliant, mid-air offload setting that try up before a slick left-to-right movement allowed Lomax to score his second. -AAP",

So it was that Rafa\u2019s old one-man show, now all sober and besuited with not a bandana in sight, was enough to effortlessly eclipse all the action going on around the outside courts, and why wouldn\u2019t it? The \u2018King of Clay\u2019 had retired last year, but to his Roland Garros disciples, that was simply unbearable. He could never be replaced, and here was one last chance for them to salute their blessed Rafa with a special ceremony two decades exactly to the day he first walked on to the centre court for a match against Xavier Malisse that launched sport\u2019s most freakish monopoly. Of course, Roland Garros did it in style, unveiling its unique and permanent tribute to the great man \u2013 his footprint set into the clay of the court \u2013 while 10,000, dolled up in their clay-coloured \u2018Merci Rafa\u2019 T-shirts, paid homage. Amid it all, the ever humble 14-time champ himself couldn\u2019t possibly survive this mass onslaught of love and, after watching a real weepie of a film outlining his unreal French Open domination from sleeveless teen to balding warrior, the tears inevitably came. \u201cMerci beaucoup,\u201d he spluttered. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to start after playing on that court for the last 20 years, after enjoying, suffering, winning, losing and especially after having felt so many feelings every time I\u2019ve had the chance to be here.\u201d Cue more roars as Nadal\u2019s adopted home saluted its most beloved visitor. \u201cMerci la France, merci Paris,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have given me emotions and moments I could never have imagined.\u201d He was joined on court by Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray and Roger Federer, sport\u2019s most famous boy band back together, while in the stands, reigning champs Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek applauded, doubtless relieved they\u2019d managed to snag a ticket. Elsewhere, the big hitters weren\u2019t let loose around the grounds, as if to leave the stage free for just one man, but of the post-Nadal-era contenders, eighth seed Lorenzo Musetti best looked the part as he pounded German qualifier Yannick Hanfmann 7-5 6-2 6-0. There was a distinct US flavour to proceedings with No.12 seed Tommy Paul beating Dane Elmer Moller 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 6-3 6-1 and 15th seed Frances Tiafoe downing Roman Safiullin 6-4 7-5 6-4. The last word though, of course had to go to Nadal on a day like this. Talking of his old foes who had come to salute him, he said of Federer, Djokovic and Murray: \u201cIt\u2019s a great message for the world that the toughest rivalries probably in the history of our sport are able to be good colleagues, to respect each other. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to hate the opponent to try to beat him with all your forces.\u201d No sentiment seemed to sum up the man better. -AAP",

        "raw_text": "Ange Postecoglou has delivered the greatest triumph of his career, clutching a potentially job-saving lifeline by steering beleaguered Tottenham Hotspur to Europa League glory in Spain. The Melbourne-raised trailblazer became the first Australian manager to win a trophy in a major European club competition as Spurs beat fellow Premier League strugglers Manchester United 1-0 in Bilbao on Wednesday night (local time) for their first silverware in 17 years. A scrappy first-half goal from Brennan Johnson was ultimately enough to give Tottenham victory in a poor-quality match during which it had to survive a tsunami of late pressure from Ruben Amorim\u2019s otherwise feeble United. But as a beaming Postecoglou celebrated the drought-busting victory at the San Mames Stadium, the only question that remained was whether victory, which guarantees Champions League football for Spurs next season, would be enough to save the 59-year-old from the sack. It\u2019s said he is already doomed, regardless of the result. If so, what a glorious way for \u201cBig Ange\u201d to make what match-winner Johnson called a glorious \u201cmike drop\u201d exit \u2013 with Tottenham\u2019s first European trophy for 41 years. Postecoglou chose this moment of glory to declare his intent: \u201cI do [want to stay]. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve completed the job here. \u201cThe moment I accepted the role, I had one thing in my head, and that is to win something \u2013 and we\u2019ve done that now. I want to build on it.\u201d Goalscorer Johnson paid tribute to Postecoglou, saying: \u201cHe\u2019s done his job. He says he wins in his second year and he has \u2013 and if there\u2019s ever a time for a mike drop, it\u2019s now.\u201d But referring to his now-celebrated early season observation that he always wins a trophy in his second season, Postecoglou said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me boasting. It was me just making a declaration \u2013 and I believed it. \u201cI know our league form\u2019s been terrible (finishing 17th), nowhere near good enough and unacceptable, but us finishing third wasn\u2019t going to change his football club. The only thing that was going to change this football club is us winning something, and when I said that, that was my intent. \u201cIf I fell short. I was happy to cop it, but I believed it inside me. That was my ambition. I wanted it stated \u2013 and I was prepared to wear it if it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d It did happen \u2013 and his players wanted to remind everyone about Postecoglou\u2019s quote as they carried around a banner proclaiming it. There\u2019s no question they\u2019re 100 per cent behind Postecoglou and his Australian staff, Nick Montgomery, Sergio Raimundo and Mile Jedinak. No matter that salvation came from a wretchedly ordinary affair to climax Europe\u2019s second-tier continental competition, one befitting two mediocre EPL sides who\u2019ve lost 44 games between them this season. Not that the Spurs\u2019 faithful will care one jot after they prevailed in this survival of the unfittest, eventually winning thanks to Johnson\u2019s scruffy goal and defensive heroics from defender Micky van de Ven and goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario. Rasmus Hojlund had a header cleared amazingly and acrobatically off the line by van de Ven. Vicario, who\u2019d already made a key second-half save from Alejandro Garnacho, pulled off another superb stop in the 97th minute from Luke Shaw\u2019s header. And Postecoglou deserved praise for getting so much right in the final. Supposedly too gung-ho and careless in approach, and too stubborn to plump for conservatism when required, the striking thing about Tottenham\u2019s late-season European march has been his pragmatism. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that kind of knockout football is different from league football.

        "raw_text": "The tragic death of former West Coast premiership player Adam Selwood at just 41 is another devastating reminder of the mental health epidemic gripping young Australians. This is especially so for men \u2013 including those who once seemed invincible on the field. Selwood\u2019s passing isn\u2019t just a personal tragedy for his family, it\u2019s a national crisis behoving a national response. In the footy world, symbolism matters. The AFL has turned themed rounds into cultural cornerstones \u2013 from the magnificent Indigenous round to AFLW Pride Round, Anzac Day and the more recent Gather Round \u2013 each designed to celebrate, educate or commemorate. Yet one gaping omission persists \u2013 mental health. In an era where the greatest sport on this Earth prides itself on being \u201cmore than just a game\u201d, this oversight borders on negligence. According to Australian Bureau of Statistics data, suicide is the leadingcause for one in three men and women aged 15-24and more than one in five people aged 25-44 in 2023\u2013 the AFL\u2019s core demographics, and the age bracket of most players. Suicide accounts for nearly double the next highest causes \u2013 accidental poisoning and land transport accidents. The 25-44 age group graphically illustrates the maleness of our national crisis: In 2023, 15.4 per cent of deaths in females aged 25-44 were due to suicide, but for males that number is 25.1 per cent. These aren\u2019t just statistics,they\u2019re stories of mates, sons and daughters, mums and dads \u2013 and yes, players \u2013 lost to mental illness. They include the names we dare not forget \u2013 Shane Tuck, Cam McCarthy, Selwood\u2019s twin Troy, and perhaps most poignantly, Danny \u201cSpud\u201d Frawley. Frawley\u2019s death in 2019shocked the footy world, not least because of his post-playing role as a mental health advocate. A fierce competitor turned gentle educator; Frawley laid bare his own battles in the hope that others might find strength in speaking up. His legacy lives on in Spud\u2019s Game, a fixture launched by St Kilda \u2013 the club he loved \u2013 to honour his mission. \u201cSpud\u2019s Game: Time 2 Talk\u201d has grown into a powerful, moving tribute. It\u2019s more than a football match. It\u2019s a platform for conversation, a fundraiser for mental health initiatives, and a living reminder of how silence can turn to tragedy. And yet, while Spud\u2019s Game is admirable, it remains a club-led initiative. The AFL supports it, promotes it, but still hasn\u2019t gone further. Why not elevate it? Why not enshrine it across all nine games in a dedicated Mental Health Round? Not just to honour Frawley, but to honour everyone in the footy community \u2013 from local volunteers to elite athletes \u2013 who grapples with the black dog. Contrast this with the league\u2019s response to other worthy causes. The Indigenous Round, now Sir Doug Nicholls Round, has rightly grown into one of the most celebrated weeks on the calendar. Pride Round, too, has opened hearts and minds. Breast cancer, motor neurone disease, gender equity, domestic violence \u2013 all find space on the AFL stage. Yet the leading cause of death for young and middle-aged women and men? This must change now. This isn\u2019t a call to abandon any existing rounds \u2013 far from it. It\u2019s a plea to add one more, as leading former player mental health advocate Wayne Schwass urges. Done properly, it could be transformative. AFL and local footy clubs could share player stories, partner with mental health organisations, offer free counselling services at games, and spark difficult conversations among fans. And most importantly, it could save lives. One of the AFL\u2019s greatest strengths is its emotional grip on Australians, especially blokes. It can reach people where government campaigns and health ads fall short. When a club like Richmond speaks, its fans listen. When a player opens up about their mental health, it resonates across locker rooms, pubs, andliving roomsin a way few institutions can. The AFL Players Association has made mental health a key concern. But without the league throwing its full weight behind the cause, we\u2019re left with piecemeal programs and after-the-fact tributes. It shouldn\u2019t take another tragic death for the AFL to act. Yes, some might argue we already talk about mental health \u201cenough\u201d. But if that were true, suicide wouldn\u2019t be our leading cause of death for people in their prime. If that were true, we wouldn\u2019t lose former elite athletes \u2013 men who appeared strong, fit, and invincible \u2013 to darkness and desperate acts. If that were true, thousands of ordinary footy fans wouldn\u2019t be suffering in silence. The AFL has made progress. Coaches and the media speak more openly about stress, anxiety, and depression. We see fewer eye rolls when players take time off to protect their mental health. Regardless, it\u2019s easy to hold themed rounds when the issues are uncontroversial or celebratory. It\u2019s harder when the subject is uncomfortable, messy, and ongoing. Exactly why we need a Mental Health Round. To pierce the silence. To name the problem. To put resources behind it. To honour those we\u2019ve lost, and support those still fighting. The AFL has a platform. It has money. It has influence. And a moral obligation to act. A dedicated AFL Mental Health Round would be a bloody good place to start. Lifeline 131 114 beyondblue 1300 224 636 Nick Dyrenfurth is executive director of the John Curtin Research Centre.",

        "raw_text": "The Victorian Government is tight-lipped on the cost of luring golf star Rory McIlroy to Melbourne, but Golf Australia boss James Sutherland says the amount could have been much higher. GA confirmed that five-time major champion and career grand slam winner McIlroy will headline this year\u2019s Australian Open and has also committed to play in 2026. Royal Melbourne on the Melbourne sandbelt will host the tournament from December 4-7 while nearby Kingston Heath is the home of the Open next year. Sutherland said that talks started with the world No.2 before his historic win at the 2025 Masters Tournament, which completed the career grand slam. That victory made McIlroy the most valuable commodity in world golf and able to command a multi-million-dollar appearance fee. \u201cThankfully, the conversation was happening before the Masters,\u201d Sutherland said at the announcement at Royal Melbourne on Wednesday morning. \u201cWe did have a moment there where, when he won the Masters, thinking, \u2018Oh, what are the implications of this? Maybe he\u2019s going to get offers from all over the world, and maybe the numbers will be different. \u201cBut fortunately Rory has been completely true to his word.\u201d McIlroy claimed the Stonehaven Cup in 2013 in a titanic battle at Royal Sydney with Adam Scott, who was in career-best form, before returning the following year to unsuccessfully defend his title at The Australian. Sutherland said playing on Melbourne\u2019s sandbelt was a lure for 35-year-old McIlroy, which helped secure him for a two-year deal. \u201cHe has for a long time expressed a desire to come here and play tournament golf on the sandbelt,\u201d Sutherland said. \u201cThe conversation\u2019s been going on for a long time, and fortunately nothing changed when he won the Masters \u2013 it just became an even more compelling proposition.\u201d McIlroy backed Sutherland\u2019s words in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be committing to the Australian Open for the next two years, especially with it being played on the world-class Melbourne sandbelt, somewhere I\u2019ve always wanted to play\u202fprofessionally\u201d McIlroy said. Like when former world No.1 Tiger Woods played in the Open in 2011, Sutherland said the appearance of the Northern Irishman would help elevate the status of the tournament and he expected a \u201cvery strong line-up\u201d. He predicted crowds to swamp the course given the popularity of McIlroy. \u201cThe popularity of Rory cuts across generations, but it also cuts across nationality,\u201d Sutherland said. \u201cEven at Augusta a few weeks ago, an Irishman going head to head with an American, Rory was as popular as any player on the course and the cheers for Rory\u2019s success and desire for him to win is huge. \u201cOver the weekend, the number of ticket enquiries we had was absolutely phenomenal.\u201d With the Open format moving away from the divisive combined event with the women\u2019s and all-abilities, Sutherland hoped to see leading local golfers such as Scott, who missed last year\u2019s tournament, sign on. \u201cTalking to the Australian golfers, it\u2019s very clear how much the Australian Open means to them and they\u2019re very proud of it and want it to be successful,\u201d Sutherland added. \u201cAdam is one of a number of current day players that have their name on the trophy but I know he would absolutely love to have his name on it again so we would be very optimistic about Adam being here to play as well.\u201d -AAP",

With the Italian Open only now beginning to get to its second-week business end in Rome, the Australian singles interest has already once again been left resting solely on the shoulders of Alex de Minaur. \u2018Demon\u2019 was left to fly the flag alone after the tame exit of Alexei Popyrin against former winner Daniil Medvedev on the SuperTennis Arena on Sunday which continues the Canadian Open winner\u2019s difficult 2025 campaign. Medvedev marched to a comfortable 6-4 6-1 victory in an hour and 26 minutes, with Popyrin evidently frustrated by his own failings as he clocked up 28 unforced errors to take his season\u2019s record to 6-10, a disappointing follow-up to his breakthrough 2024 campaign.  With the French Open just a fortnight away, the Australian contingent\u2019s recent struggles on clay have been striking. The 11 who started in the main draw in Rome, men and women, have all departed before the second week, except for de Minaur. He had battled past Luca Nardi and an irritating front-row spectator on Saturday night and will be a warm favourite to make the last-16 when he faces Bolivian lucky loser Hugo Dellien on Monday, with the South American happy to be gifted his second chance after being defeated in qualifying. Elsewhere in the men\u2019s draw on Sunday, the big guns began to fire with title holder Alexander Zverev strolling into the last 16 with a 6-4 6-0 win over Lithuanian qualifier Vilius Gaubas. Third seed Carlos Alcaraz then continued his impressive reurn from injury with a 7-6 (7-2) 6-2 victory over Serbian Laslo Djere on the main Campo Centrale arena. Earlier, Stefanos Tsitsipas had ended up in a heated and lengthy discussion with his conqueror Arthur Fils after his 2-6 6-4 6-2 defeat, with the umpire having to come down off his chair and keep a close eye on the pair as supporters in the SuperTennis Arena jeered and whistled. The animated head-to-head centred on a moment when Tsitsipas tagged Fils with a booming backhand during the second set, with the 20-year-old Frenchman apparently using it as his fuel for victory. But there appeared no bad blood between the pair as they left the arena following the discussion. British star Jack Draper recorded his 100th tour win but admitted his frustration had boiled over as he smashed a racquet en route to beating Czech qualifier Vit Kopria 6-4 6-3. \u2014AAP",

In his third match the now 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi has smashed the second-fastest century in the IPL\u2019s 18 seasons, a blistering 35-ball display that carried his team to a thumping eight-wicket victory over Gujarat Titans in Jaipur on Monday. Only \u201cUniverse Boss\u201d Chris Gayle has hit a quicker IPL ton than his fellow left-hander, and \u201cBaby Boss\u201d Suryavanshi would have been close to his 30-ball display had he not played himself in with nine runs off his first seven balls, albeit that included a straight six off 140km/h Indian Test seamer Ishant Sharma. Thereafter he hit 92 off 28 balls, including 10 more sixes and seven fours. A couple of boundaries were streaky, but most were hit with devastating power and fearless clean hitting all around the wicket. His century was brought up with a six over midwicket, off the skilled legspinner Rashid Khan. Every boundary was rapturously cheered by the pink-clad Royals fans in the \u2018Pink City\u2019, none of whom will ever forget the night. By the time Suryavanshi was yorked for 101, the Royals were well on the way to overhauling Titans\u2019 4-209, doing so with 25 balls to spare, to end a five-match losing streak. Yashasvi Jaiswal, dropped by wicketkeeper Jos Buttler on two, made 70 not out. \u201cIncredible innings, one of the best I have seen,\u201d said Jaiswal, who was hailed as a tyro when making Test and IPL centuries as a 21-year-old two years ago, of Suryavanshi, whose innings was made against a high-class attack of Test bowlers. \u201cI hope he will do it for us for a long time. \u201cI was telling him to just keep going. He just played amazing shots, he practises well, works hard in the nets.

I don\u2019t see the ground so much, just focus on the ball. \u201cIt is like a dream, to score a century in the IPL.\u201d While the Titans, third with 12 points, are still well-placed to make the play-offs, the Royals (eighth, six points), are unlikely to do so. Nevertheless, they has provided what will probably be the most memorable occasion of the tournament. -AAP",

The former England cricket star suffered a serious accident while filming the popular BBC program in 2022, enduring major facial injuries. The incident took place on atTop Gear\u2018s test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome when the open-topped Morgan Super 3 Flintoff was driving flipped and slid, dragging him face down along the track. Flintoff speaks about the incident in depth for the first time in a new Disney+ documentaryFlintoff, which premieres on Friday, offering an unflinching account of the incident. The film contains still images from the scene of the accident and some graphic shots of his wounds, but Flintoff\u2019s account is even more harrowing. At one stage, he admits: \u201cAfter the accident I didn\u2019t think I had it in me to get through. This sounds awful \u2026 part of me wishes I\u2019d been killed. Part of me thinks, I wish I\u2019d died. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to kill myself \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t mistake the two things. I was not wishing, I was just thinking, \u2018this would have been so much easier\u2019,\u201d Flintoff says. \u201cNow I try to take the attitude that the sun will come up tomorrow and my kids will still give me a hug. I\u2019m probably in a better place now.\u201d The documentary, made by director John Dower, includes contributions from former teammates Michael Vaughan, Steve Harmison and Rob Key as well as family members and show business friends James Corden and Jack Whitehall. There is also an appearance by his surgeon Jahrad Haq, who describes Flintoff\u2019s injuries as one of the five worst he has come across in 20 years and likes the reconstruction process to a jigsaw with missing pieces. Haq said the injuries were \u201cvery complex\u201d \u2013 a mixture of hard and soft tissue injuries, broken teeth, lost teeth and elements of the upper jaw bone that were also fractured and displaced. \u201c[He] lost a really significant portion of his upper lip \u2013 the skin and some of the underlying muscle, and also his lower lip,\u201d he said. Flintoff reveals he demanded to see footage of the crash and talks at length about the terror he felt in the moment. \u201cI remember my head got hit, I got dragged out. I went over the back of the car and it pulled my face down on the runway, about 50 metres, underneath the car,\u201d he said. \u201cMy biggest fear was, I didn\u2019t think I had a face. I thought my face had come off. I was frightened to death.\u201d The BBC \u201crested\u201d Top Gear for the foreseeable future in 2023 after reaching a financial settlement with Flintoff, an agreement reportedly worth around \u00a39 million ($19 million). The 47-year-old appears resentful about the entertainment culture he was involved in, likening it to his own injury-ravaged playing career. \u201cEverybody wants more. Everybody want to dig that bit deeper,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned this in sport as well. All the injuries, all the injections, all the times I got sent out on a cricket field and treated like a piece of meat. That\u2019s TV and sport. It\u2019s quite similar, you\u2019re just a commodity.

        "raw_text": "Australia\u2019s 17-year-old sprinting sensation Gout Gout has blitzed yet another milestone on his way to global domination. Gout clocked in at 19.84 seconds to win the men\u2019s 200-metre finalat the Australian Athletics Championships in Perthlast weekend. The effort would have secured the Queensland teenager a record, but for an illegal wind speed of 2.2 metres a second. Even more astonishingly, advanced biomechanical analysis by Flinders University has found that Gout\u2019s maximum step length during the race matched that of Usain Bolt during his 100-metre world record in the 2009 Berlin World Championships. Movement scientist Dr Dylan Hicks said Gout\u2019s average step length in the final 100 metres was 2.69 metres, peaking at an extraordinary 2.86 metres \u2013 equal to Bolt\u2019s maximum step length during his 100-metre world record in Berlin in 2009, \u201cwhich appears key to his record performance\u201d. The 17-year-old created worldwide headlines last week after twice running the 100-metre sprint in Perth in 9.99 seconds. Neither counted as an official time given the strong tailwind. On Sunday, Gout sent WA Athletics Stadium into overdrive when he ran the 200m in 19.84 seconds. This time the tailwind was only marginally over the legal limit. The speed means the young athlete\u2019s quest to officially go sub-10 in the 100 metres and sub-20 in the 200 metres continues. \u201cThese are the steps you take to the top, and the steps I have to take to potentially become a world champion or an Olympic champion,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I can get these little steps, focus on the little things, I think I can take it far.\u201d For his part, Bolt has also noticed the rising Australia. \u201cHe looks like young me,\u201dhe wrote on Instagramfollowing a video of a Gout performance back in December. Gout is indeed shaping up as a global sprinting great, which Hicks has attributed to a combination of \u201cunique coordination patterns, biomechanics, technical efficiency\u201d. In addition to Gout\u2019s remarkable step length, Hicks said the young star\u2019s speed had improved in the first 100 metres \u201cfrom 9.37 metres a second (which took him 10.67 seconds) in his 19.98-second [200-metre race at the Queensland Athletics Championships] last month to 9.59 metres a second (10.43 seconds) in Perth.\u201d Combined with his ability to maintain speed throughout the race, this helped Gout run his (almost) record-breaking time. But, according to Hicks, it\u2019s Gout\u2019s unique movement signature \u2013 how his foot interacts with the ground \u2013 that really stands out. \u201cI believe it is Gout\u2019s unique ability to store and release elastic strain energy via the muscle-achilles tendon unit which provides a greater force amplification effect (between the foot and the ground) \u2014 allowing Gout to move faster for longer, with less energy cost,\u201d he said. \u201cAlong with good coaching and hard work, this biomechanical difference appears to set Gout apart from almost anyone else in the world.\u201d Gout will have his next race at the Stawell Gift meet in western Victoria over the Easter long weekend.

        "raw_text": "Matildas star Mary Fowler has ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and is in a race against time to play in next year\u2019s home Asian Cup. Manchester City had been hopeful the brilliant winger had avoided the dreaded injury, suffered when she appeared to wrench her right knee while overstretching for the ball on Sunday. The injury forced Fowler out of the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United, which City ultimately lost 2-0, inside 20 minutes. City interim manager Nick Cushing had admitted it \u201cdoesn\u2019t look great imminently\u201d but said City were \u201cnot fearing the worst.\u201d But scans confirmed the 22-year-old had suffered the dreaded injury, which means a full knee reconstruction. \u201cManchester City can confirm Mary Fowler has suffered a rupture to her anterior cruciate ligament,\u201d City said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cMary will remain under the care of the club\u2019s medical team and start her rehabilitation. \u201cEveryone at City wishes Mary all the best on a full and speedy recovery.\u201d It will likely rule Fowler out for close to a year, in a hammer blow to Australia\u2019s hopes next March of winning the Women\u2019s Asian Cup for the first time since 2010. The attacker has been in dynamic form for City, scoring 10 goals across all competitions, and underlined her ability with a starring role in Australia\u2019s friendlies against South Korea earlier this month. \u201cI\u2019m really disappointed to be facing some time out of the game,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cIt\u2019s never easy when something like this happens especially when you\u2019ve been working so hard and feeling good. \u201cThe road ahead will be challenging, but I\u2019m ready to take it on. \u201cThere\u2019s still so much I want to achieve, and I\u2019ll be using this time to grow in every way I can. \u201cI\u2019m committed to doing the work, staying positive and coming back better than ever.\u201d Fowler\u2019s injury also means the new Matildas coach, widely expected to be current Lyon boss Joe Montemurro, will be unable to call on her early in their tenure. \u201cEveryone in the Matildas and Football Australia family \u2013 players, coaches, and support staff \u2013 will be right behind Mary as she takes the first steps toward her comeback,\u201d interim coach Tom Sermanni said. Losing Fowler also piles more pressure on Arsenal star Caitlin Foord to be Australia\u2019s main attacking threat. The Matildas are still without skipper Sam Kerr, who suffered the second ruptured ACL of her career during a training camp with Chelsea in January 2024. Kerr, who joined her Matildas teammates in camp this month, is still considered several weeks away from playing. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to put a timeframe on it,\u201d Chelsea coach Sonia Bompastor said on the weekend.",

        "raw_text": "Rory McIlroy has defied another Masters meltdown to win in a playoff from Justin Rose and become the first European to secure a career grand slam more than a decade in the making. The Northern Irishman (11 under, 72, 66, 66, 73) was four shots clear through 10 holes on Sunday (local time). But, as he also did 14 years ago at Augusta National, he stumbled with five dropped shots as Rose (65, 71, 75, 66) surged to finish level. A bogey on the last hole of regulation forced a sudden-death playoff and both men had birdie putts on the first extra hole, McIlroy putting his approach to a metre after Rose\u2019s had settled 4\u00bd metres away. Rose\u2019s effort slid by, before McIlroy tapped in to clinch his maiden Masters title and first major in 11 years. The 35-year-old fell to the ground in relief after his putt dropped, having watched a 1\u00bd-metre par attempt on the same hole slide by minutes earlier that would have sealed the triumph in regulation. Tiger Woods was the last man to complete the set of all four majors when he dominated the British Open in his first attempt at the career grand slam in 2000. \u201cIt was 14 years in the making; I feel like I could have got it done there,\u201d McIlroy said of the 2011 Masters fadeout that has haunted him. \u201cThere was a lot of pent-up emotion that just came out on that 18th green \u201cA moment like that just makes \u2026 all the close calls worth it.\u201d Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus are the only other members of the career grand slam club. The roller-coaster final day started with McIlroy two shots clear of Bryson DeChambeau (seven under) with the American briefly leading after just two holes before fading as the chasing pack surged. Leading by four after the 10th, he dropped a shot on the 11th and then inexplicably found water with a wedge despite laying up on 13th. That fourth double bogey for his tournament is now a quirky record among champions. When his curling putt on the 14th sat on the lip of the cup but didn\u2019t drop and he\u2019d lost the lead. Rose, who led for a record fifth time after the first round, bogeyed the 17th but then drained a six-metre putt on the 18th to heap pressure on the leader. McIlroy found the sand with his wedge approach and then pulled his par putt to fall into the playoff. He delivered again with an iron, as he had done with scintillating approaches to the 15th and 17th for birdies, to secure victory. The whirlwind began on Thursday when McIlroy went back to par with a pair of double bogeys and sat seven behind fast-starting Rose. Only Nick Faldo in 1990 and Woods in 2005 had previously come from that far back after the opening round to win. But McIlroy launched his comeback with a back nine of 31 and exploded out of the blocks with a record six consecutive threes to start on Saturday. \u201cAll week I responded to setbacks,\u201d he said. Patrick Reed (nine under) holed out for eagle on the 17th to finish outright third. Scottie Scheffler (eight under) was fourth and Australian Jason Day dropped shots on the last two holes to finish five under and in a tie for eighth. Rose fell just short of executing the second-biggest Masters comeback after starting the final day seven shots behind. The former world No.1, US Open and Olympic champion, joins Greg Norman as a three-time Masters runner-up and Ben Hogan as the only loser of multiple playoffs after his 2017 defeat to Sergio Garcia. Min Woo Lee, Australia\u2019s only other cut survivor, was two over on Sunday to finish six over for the tournament in 49th. -AAP",

Kennedy ran a personal-best 10.00 in his heat win at the WA Athletics Stadium on Friday, and immediately set his sights on bettering the Australian record of 9.93 set by Patrick Johnson in Japan in 2003. But it was veteran Browning who came up trumps in a photo finish in Saturday night\u2019s final in Perth, equalling his career-best run from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. Browning\u2019s final time of 10.01 (.001) bettered that of Kennedy 10.01 (.006) by five-thousandths of a second. Joshua Azzopardi (10.17) finished third.

In the women\u2019s 100m final on Saturday night, national record holder Torrie Lewis beat 17-year-old rising star Leah O\u2019Brien and Bree Rizzo in a drama-filled photo-finish.

I\u2019m happy for both of you\u2019. Whoever gets it, gets it.\u201d Olympic silver medallist Jessica Hull won the 1500m women\u2019s national title for the third year running after going for broke with 400m to go. The pace was slow for most of the race, but Hull was able to create enough of a gap to win in 4:11.36, just ahead of Sarah Billings (4:11.51) and Georgia Griffith (4:12.09). \u201cIt was a very strange race,\u201d said Hull, who was competing just days after taking part in the grand slam track meet in Jamaica. \u201cI think in my mind, I kind of probably thought Linden (Hall) would take up the running. In the first 200 she was boxed in on the rail pretty deep. \u201cI was like, \u2018OK, it\u2019s not going to be Linden and I don\u2019t think anyone else is going to go, so just buckle up for the last 400\u2019.\u201d In the men\u2019s 1500m final, 18-year-old rising star Cameron Myers (3:34.39) held on at the death to beat Adam Spencer (3:34.57) and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Oliver Hoare (3:34.61). -AAP",

Kennedy recorded the second-fastest time for the 100-metre sprint in Australian athletic history. It followed 17-year-old headline grabber Gout Gout running 9.99 seconds \u2014 but with an illegal assisted tailwind \u2014 just 24 hours earlier in the Under-20 100m sprint. It means Gout\u2019s official best remains 10.17. Kennedy flew down the running track to blitz the open men\u2019s field in his first-round heat on Friday, with a time of 10.00 with a legal 0.9 m/s tailwind. Remarkably, Kennedy achieved the time without pushing his body to the max. The fastest Australian time of 9.93 seconds is still held by Patrick Johnson who achieved the feat in Mito, Japan in 2003. Kennedy now ranks second with his 10.00. Rohan Browning (9.96 seconds) and Gout (9.99 seconds) have broken the 10-second mark, but only with illegal tailwinds. Kennedy, who will run in the semi-finals and final on Saturday, now has his sights set on the Australian record. \u201cIt feels pretty good. Hopefully I can be the quickest ever by the end of the week,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cAndrew (Iselin) my coach was telling me to give it everything, because he thought it was going to be the best conditions. \u201cBut I really want to save all my juice for the final, because I want the final to be intense. \u201cI might have subconsciously shut off. Like I was staring at the clock with 30 metres to go, and I was like, \u2018I might actually get this\u2019. \u201cWith a dip, it could have been nine, but I\u2019ve got two more races to do that.\u201d On a lightning-fast night in Perth for the 100m heats, Rohan Browning posted a wind-assisted 10.07, Sebastian Sultana recorded a legal 10.12, and Calab Law posted a wind-assisted 10.13. Jack Hale also put in a promising display with his legal time of 10.23. Kennedy and Gout will go head-to-head in the 200m on Sunday in what is shaping as another mouth-watering event. Gout broke Peter Norman\u2019s 56-year-old Australian 200m record late last year when he clocked 20.04 seconds \u2013 a time faster than Bolt ran at the same age (20.13). But Kennedy caused an upset last month when he posted 20.26 to beat Gout by four tenths of a second at the Maurie Plant Meet in Melbourne. \u201cI\u2019m definitely looking forward to it. We have a great rivalry,\u201d Gout said ahead of Sunday\u2019s re-match. \u201cAnd being out here in Perth, it\u2019s a great track, so couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d Kennedy says he will definitely contest his 200m heat on Sunday, but will see how his body is feeling before deciding whether to back up for the final two hours later. In the women\u2019s 100m heats on Friday, current national record holder Torrie Lewis and Bree Rizzo both posted 11.25, while 17-year-old rising star Leah O\u2019Brien (11.31) and Mia Gross (11.33) were also quick.

Only runs with a 2m/s tailwind or less are considered legal, and the 3.5m/s tailwind meant Gout\u2019s first career sub 10-second run didn\u2019t officially count.

The Matildas have been without a full-time coach for eight months since Tony Gustavsson\u2019s official departure on August 1 after the Paris Olympics. In their 11th game under caretaker Tom Sermanni, Australia defeated South Korea 2-0 at Newcastle\u2019s McDonald Jones Stadium on Monday night, to claim their first back-to-back wins of the year. The South Korea friendlies are hoped to be the last under Sermanni, with FA having flagged a coach will be in place by mid-year and the Matildas\u2019 May and June friendlies against Argentina in Melbourne and Canberra. Sermanni is unsure that will be the case, as pressure mounts on FA given the ever-shortening runway to the looming 2026 Asian Cup to be hosted by Australia. Expressing relief at claiming a clean sweep of the two-match series with South Korea, Catley admitted the Matildas\u2019 rebuild had been difficult without a permanent coach. \u201cWe are at very early stages of a rebuild and that happens every cycle when you\u2019re leading into major tournaments and we\u2019ve got a year to build \u2013 well, less than a year now, but that\u2019s what it\u2019s about,\u201d Catley said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard as a playing group when you\u2019re in limbo a little bit. \u201cYou haven\u2019t got clear direction in how we\u2019re going to play moving forward. \u201cTommy\u2019s done a great job coming in.

The situation offering authorities an opportunity to improve security measures following the investigation, says Percy-Dove who believes it will happen again. \u201cThere\u2019s almost an assumption that when we go to major events \u2026 there will be members of the community who have weapons on them, and that will be the same everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a practical way at the moment of how it can be stopped.\u201d The MCG underwent a major security upgrade in 2024, including the rollout of sensors with artificial intelligence that can differentiate between weapons and common metals people carry. Fans should expect delays at upcoming events after the stadium blamed the incident on issues with a manual security screening. \u201cSecurity has to be cohesive, and if you\u2019ve got technology in place to detect things, it has to be reliably supported by people, processes and training to ensure security works effectively,\u201d Percy-Dove said. \u201cThe vulnerability in our industry, unfortunately, is not the technology, but the staff.\u201d AAP understands additional measures will be implemented at the ground, including increased security staff and more wanding. Hawthorn captain James Sicily, who has played at the venue twice this season, understood why the incident would shock people. \u201cI\u2019m just worried about getting a kick when you\u2019re on the field,\u201d he said. \u201cBut definitely as a patron, that\u2019s very worrying and I\u2019d assume there would be some higher security checks being taken.\u201d Sydney midfielder James Rowbottom said the incident was a weird one, but he has always felt safe on game day. \u201cI\u2019m glad nothing happened, but it\u2019s obviously a pretty terrible position for someone to put the crowd and the players in as well,\u201d he told AAP. \u2014AAP",

        "raw_text": "Cricket legend Shane Warne had multiple bottles of drugs at his bedside when he was found dead in a Thai hotel room, a bombshell report alleges. The former Australian cricketerdied in March 2022 while on holiday on the Thai island of Koh Samui. The 52-year-old was found unresponsive in his rooms at the luxurious Samujana Villas just an hour after two women were seen on CCTV leaving his room. A newly unearthed medical report, revealed byThe Sunmore than three years after his death, lists two types of Viagra and a drug known to improve longevity that were found in the bedroom in his suite. The document reveals paramedics who rushed to the room discovered Sildenafil, marketed as Viagra, Kamagra, an unregulated version of Viagra available in jelly sachets, and Dapoxetine, a drug used to prevent premature ejaculation. Kamagra is illegal in Thailand, but is widely available over the counter. Viagra and Dapoxetine are legal with a prescription, but can also be bought on the black market. It remains unclear whether Warne had taken any of the drugs before his death. But the cricketer was known to have a history of heart issues, and the medications carry warnings for those with cardiovascular conditions. An autopsy conducted in Thailand concluded Warne died of natural causes due to congenital heart disease. The report ruled out foul play, according toThe Sun. But reports surfaced last weekend alleging Thai police removed Kamagra from Warne\u2019s hotel room during their investigation. This week, News Corp reported Warne had openly spoken about using Viagra during his relationship with actress and model Elizabeth Hurley. Warne was staying at the Smujana Villas resort on a holiday with three friends at the time of his death. CCTV footage from the resort showed two massage therapists leaving his villa shortly before he was found unconscious about 5pm by Andrew Neophitou, the executive producer of a documentary on Warne\u2019s life and career. \u201cThey were meant to meet some people at 5pm. Neo was next door, he\u2019s always on time,\u201d Warne\u2019s manager, James Erskine, said in 2022. \u201cHe realised [Warne] wasn\u2019t well. He tried to give mouth-to-mouth, tried to resuscitate him, he had no heartbeat.\u201d Warne\u2019s friends called for an ambulance at 5.40pm, with paramedics arriving at 6pm. The medical report details how emergency responders began CPR at 6.10pm and transported Warne to Thailand International Hospital. \u201cWhen he arrived at hospital his face was green and pale, he had black blood in his nose and mouth, which was unusual. There was no sign of life,\u201d\u00a0Dr Dulyakit Wittayachanyapong, who oversaw Warne\u2019s treatment at the hospital, toldThe Sun Online. Hospital staff attempted resuscitation for 43 minutes before Warne was declared dead at 6.53pm. The medical report states that doctors intubated him and administered adrenaline and sodium bicarbonate in efforts to revive him. Blood tests at the hospital revealed his oxygen levels had dropped to a critical 40 per cent. During his 15-year international career, Warne was widely regarded as one of cricket\u2019s greatest leg-spinners. Off the pitch, he was known for his flamboyant lifestyle. His 10-year marriage to Simone Callahan, with whom he had three children, ended in divorce. He was later engaged to Hurley, though the couple eventually separated. Warne, a habitual smoker and drinker, had also been on a liquid diet in the weeks leading up to his death. \u201cOperation shred has started (10 days in) & the goal by July is to get back to this shape from a few years ago,\u201d he wrote above a bare-chested picture of his taut, ripped younger self posted to social media on the night he arrived at Samujana Villas. -with AAP",

        "raw_text": "Former Richmond and Collingwood AFL player Andrew Krakouer has been remembered as a \u201cspecial talent\u201d after he died in Perth from a suspected heart attack, aged 42. Krakouer played 102 games for the Tigers (2001-2007) and 35 for the Magpies (2011-2013), kicking three goals in the Pies\u2019 2011 grand-final loss to Geelong. His AFL comeback came after he was jailed in 2008 for 16 months over a serious assault. Former Collingwood coach Nathan Buckley described 2011 mark-of-the-year winner Krakouer as \u201ca genius\u201d on the field. \u201cHe made the most of his opportunities,\u201d Buckley said on SEN. \u201cHe was troubled at times, but what a brilliant footballer. Really calm, quiet teammate who was respectful and went about his business. \u201cI really enjoyed the years with him, and that\u2019s really sad for his family, first and foremost. \u201cHe was just a genius. He was just a player who could do the special things \u2026 the hanger he took in 2011 on Marvel [Stadium] was elite. \u201cHe loved the game, found a way to impact and could do things other players couldn\u2019t do. He was exceptional.\u201d Krakouer fell out with Collingwood following the 2021 \u201cDo Better\u201d report into allegations of racism, but made peace with the club the following year. He was remembered by former Richmond teammate Matthew Richardson as \u201ca beautiful man who was loved by all his teammates\u201d. Ex-Tigers chief executive Brendon Gale said Krakouer was \u201cdeeply loved\u201d and a \u201cspecial talent\u201d. Krakouer was a star at state-league level, delivering a brilliant 2010 WAFL season that earned him a second chance in the AFL. He won the Sandover Medal as the WAFL\u2019s best player that season and was awarded the Simpson Medal as best afield in Swan Districts\u2019 grand-final win over Claremont. Krakouer tallied 42 disposals and four goals in the decider, kicking the match-winner in the dying seconds of a one-point victory that clinched Swans\u2019 first premiership in 20 years. He kicked 35 goals in 23 games during his 2011 AFL comeback but ruptured an ACL during the following pre-season. Krakouer returned late in 2012 but was delisted by Collingwood at the end of 2013. He later worked in football media and co-authored a children\u2019s book \u2013 \u201cMy Dad\u2019s Gone Away\u201d \u2013 which addresses the experiences of children with incarcerated parents. Krakouer\u2019s father Jim and uncle Phil were stars with Claremont in the WAFL and North Melbourne in the VFL during the 1980s. -AAP",

        "raw_text": "Sam Kerr has returned to the Matildas squad and will retain her captaincy following a London court\u2019s verdict in her racial harassment case. Kerr, will link up with teammates in a non-playing capacity in Sydney this week, for the first time in more than a year. It follows her recent UK court case,where she was found not guilty on one charge of racially-aggravated harassment of a police officer. It also follows a meeting with the Football Australia board. In a statement on Monday, the board said the case would not affect Kerr\u2019s leadership of the Matildas. Kerr, who hasn\u2019t played since tearing her ACL during a Chelsea training camp in January last year, spoke of her \u201cregret\u201d for the incident, with the FA board concluding that it warranted no further action. \u201cI want to express my sincere regret for how events unfolded,\u201d Kerr said in Monday\u2019s FA statement. \u201cIt was an incredibly difficult period for me, my family, my club, my teammates, and especially for the fans whose support means so much to us. \u201cI recognise that leadership means being mindful of our actions both on and off the pitch. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the Matildas, the role I have played as a member of that team, and everything we stand for, and I\u2019m committed to learning from this experience.\u201d Crucially, it means Kerr\u2019s captaincy, which she has held since 2019, has been settled before the Matildas\u2019 next coach is appointed. Tony Gustavsson\u2019s permanent replacement is expected to be in place by mid-year. Interim coach Tom Sermanni, who debuted Kerr, 31, as a 15-year-old in 2009, will oversee the striker\u2019s first camp since February\u2019s high-profile court case. Kerr was charged after calling a police officer \u201cf\u2014ing stupid and white\u201d late in an hour-long altercation at Twickenham police station early on January 30, 2023. That followed a taxi journey that went sour when a drunk Kerr vomited out of the window. The altercation with police turned heated after it became clear the officers did not believe Kerr and fiancee Kristie Mewis\u2019s telling of events. FA was blindsided when Kerr\u2019s charge came to light in March 2024. On Monday, it noted the incident had \u201cimplications\u201d in relation to its code of conduct, but stopped short of saying Kerr had breached it. Chairman Anter Isaac said the incident shouldn\u2019t overshadow Kerr\u2019s contribution to the game. \u201cKnowing how Sam [Kerr] feels about the events, along with the additional context we\u2019ve learned, has added vital perspective that the general public may not be aware of,\u201d said Isaac. \u201cSetting aside those difficulties, this one incident should not offset the incredible contributions she has made, both publicly and privately, on and off the field \u2013 for more than 15 years.\u201d As part of her return-to-play program, Kerr has joined the Matildas for the March 31-April 8 international window. Granted leave by Chelsea, she will continue her rehabilitation under the supervision of the Matildas\u2019 performance support team. Kerr, who is Australia\u2019s greatest goal scorer, has not yet been cleared for competitive football. But the Matildas will be hopeful she\u2019s available to face Argentina in Melbourne on May 30 and Canberra on June 2. -AAP",

Nine days after winning silver in the 60-metre dash at the world indoors in China, the 21-year-old Kennedy did the 100-200-metre double at Lakeside Stadium on Saturday night in front of a capacity crowd of 10,000. Many of them were there primarily to see 17-year-old Gout run against men for the first time. But it was fellow Queenslander Kennedy who stole the show, winning the 200 metres in a huge personal best of 20.26 seconds. A fast-finishing Gout was second across the line in 20.30. \u201cI just wanted to give everyone a good race,\u201d said Kennedy. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be fun if he just destroyed everyone. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I did spoil it a little bit, but what a great race. \u201cYou can\u2019t be upset about watching something like that.\u201d The next instalment of the burgeoning Kennedy-Gout friendly rivalry will come at the Australian championships in Perth in mid-April. So far, Gout\u2019s history-making feats \u2013 which include breaking the 56-year-old Australian 200-metre record late last year \u2013 have come against fellow junior athletes. He learnt plenty from his first big outing on the senior stage. \u201cThat\u2019s what you live for \u2013 this environment, the hype, the people, the expectation, the pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is sport right. This is what I go to training every day for.\u201d The Peter Norman Memorial 200 metres was the closing event of the biggest single night of athletics on Australian soil in years and it lived up to the hype. The runners were held in the blocks for much longer than usual, which only added to the anticipation. \u201cThe experience is second to none,\u201d said Gout. \u201cThis is something you can only get from a big meet, a Continental Gold meet, world championships and Olympics. \u201cGetting more runs like this will be great for me. \u201cThe silence was definitely crazy, the silence was loud \u2013 that\u2019s what they say.\u201d A couple of hours earlier, Kennedy won the 100 metres in 10.17 into a slight headwind. Reigning national champion Sebastian Sultana came home strongly for second in 10.29, just ahead of Rohan Browning (10.30). Another star teenage member of Australian track and field\u2019s Generation Next, Cameron Myers, won the John Landy 1500 metres in grand style. The 18-year-old Myers took up the running with 700 metres to go and stormed away to win in three minutes 34.98 seconds ahead of Adam Spencer in 3:35.52. Fifteen-year-old New Zealander Sam Ruthe, who earlier this month became the youngest person to run a sub-four minute mile, was seventh. Botswana\u2019s Bayapo Ndori caused a big boilover in the men\u2019s 400 metres by holding off his countryman and reigning Olympic 200-metre champ Letsile Tebogo to win in 45.14. Tebogo was second in 45.26, with Cooper Sherman the first Australian across the line in fourth (45.74). Ndori and Tebogo were both members of the Botswana team that claimed 4\u00d7400-metre silver at the Paris Olympics. Teen sensation Claudia Hollingsworth timed her run to perfection to win a high-quality women\u2019s 1500 metres in 4:06.00. Fellow Australians Sarah Billings and three-time Olympian Linden Hall filled the minor placings. National 100m record holder Torrie Lewis was never in contention in the women\u2019s 200 metres, finishing fifth in a race won by fellow Australian Kristie Edwards in 23.18. Full-time physiotherapist Seth O\u2019Donnell made all the running in the men\u2019s 5000 metres, only to be mowed down by world indoors bronze medallist Ky Robinson. The 23-year-old Robinson took the lead with 600 metres to run and powered away to win in a personal best of 13:13.17. Former world champ Eleanor Patterson won the women\u2019s high jump with a best clearance of 1.94 metres and Olympic bronze medallist Matt Denny was a dominant winner of the men\u2019s discus (68.17 metres). -AAP",

        "raw_text": "A new stadium will be built in Brisbane as the centrepiece of the 2032 Olympic Games, along with a host of venues and arenas across \u201cevery corner\u201d of the state, Premier David Crisafulli has revealed. After a 100-day review of the Olympics plan, Crisafulli said the government decided it would not upgrade the existing ageing stadium in Woolloongabba, which had been an area of contention. Despite having vowed as an election pitch that there would be \u201cno new stadiums\u201d, Crisafulli said on Tuesday a new 60,000-seat stadium would be built at Victoria Park, in inner-city Brisbane \u2014 an area of green space that was formerly a golf course. The plan has already sparked community protest, with residents complaining that it is a heritage-listed area with 100-year-old trees. The Save Victoria Park group said it was not surprised, but \u201chorrified\u201d at the confirmation. Crisafulli said it came down to choosing between the \u201cembarrassment\u201d of hosting the games at the existing athletic stadium (QSAC) or building a new one at Victoria Park. The new LNP government\u2019s plan for the 2032 Games has also axed a proposed Brisbane Arena in the CBD to host concerts and swimming, with the allocated federal funding to be redirected elsewhere. Crisafulli apologised for breaking his election commitment about stadiums, while promising the Games would create a legacy for Queensland. \u201cWhen the eyes of the world turn to Queensland, let them see the great people that call this state home,\u201d he said. \u201cLet them see we\u2019re not Paris, we\u2019re not LA. This will be better and it will be the Queensland way. And that\u2019s what will make the Games great. \u201cQueensland has a plan to deliver 2032 and beyond. Now, let\u2019s get on with it.\u201d He also revealed a list ofQueenslandlocations that will host events and benefit from new sporting and transport infrastructure. They include a new 25,000-seat national aquatic centreat the Centenary Pool in Spring Hill to host pool-based events. The Queensland Tennis Centre will be upgraded so the sport can be played in the state, avoiding mooted plans for the Games matches to be moved to Melbourne. The main athletes\u2019 village will be at the RNA Showgrounds, in Herston, with 20,000-seat stadium planned next to it. There will also be an athletess village on the Gold Coast at Royal Pines and another on the Sunshine Coast, in the Maroochy CBD. Crisafulli said the $7 billion Olympics spend would be spread out across Queensland, with events from Cairns in the north to the Gold Coast in the south. They include horse events at a new equestrian centre of excellence to be built in Toowoomba, west of Brisbane. Rowing will be held in Rockhampton, on the Fitzroy River \u2013 which is known to have crocodile sightings. Crisafulli noted that Rockhampton had already hosted Australian and international-level rowing training camps. Football and basketball will be played in Cairns, sailing in Townsville and the Whitsundays, archery in Maryborough and cricket in Mackay. Hockey will be happy, with the sport to be based on the Gold Coast at a revamped 2018 Commonwealth Games venue instead of Brisbane\u2019s Ballymore rugby field. New roads and rail will be built as part of the Games\u2019 future legacy, including a major upgrade of the Sunshine Coast railway line, providing the first rail transport to the coastal suburbs. The announcement on the Games blueprint follows a 100-day review and several false starts since Brisbane was named host in July 2021. The Queensland government and the Commonwealth had agreed to a $7.1 billion funding envelope for venues split 50-50, with $2.5 billion federal dollars allocated to the Brisbane Arena. The Brisbane Games will also be a \u201cswansong\u201d for traditional cricket and AFL home, the Gabba. It will become an entertainment hub post-2032. The clock is ticking for organisers with a venue plan finally confirmed almost four years since Brisbane was named Olympic host. -with AAP",

Australia coach Tom Sermanni had been confident the star striker would be able to return to action for their two-match series on home soil but was overruled by Chelsea. Sonia Bompastor, coach of the Women\u2019s Super League club, had last week ruled out any prospect of Kerr returning to competitive action until mid-April at the earliest after the looming international break. \u201cSam\u2019s still making a comeback from her knee operation a year and a bit ago,\u201d Sermanni said on Monday in Newcastle. \u201cShe\u2019s not been fully cleared yet by Chelsea. She\u2019s on the mend and she\u2019s not too far off. \u201cHer first priority is to get her on the field at Chelsea and then hopefully she\u2019ll be available for selection for the Matildas.\u201d Kerr has not played since tearing an anterior cruciate ligament during the her club\u2019s warm weather training camp in Morocco in 2024. It had been hoped the 31-year-old would bolster a floundering Matildas side against South Korea, having been sorely missed in their disastrous Olympics and SheBelieves Cup campaigns. Knocked out in the group stages of the Paris Games, the Matildas left the US in February without a single point. Australia\u2019s national women\u2019s team has since slumped to its equal-worst position in the history of FIFA world rankings since they were introduced in 2003, down to No.16. A-League Women stars Holly McNamara and Michelle Heyman remain in Sermanni\u2019s squad as attacking options in Kerr\u2019s absence, alongside Mary Fowler and Hayley Raso. Sermanni has recalled young defenders Courtney Nevin and Jamilla Rankin, while midfielder Clare Wheeler returns after missing out on the last two international windows through injury. Daniela Galic, Laini Freier and Alana Murphy make way for the new inclusions. The Matildas begin their path to the 2026 Asian Cup when they play South Korea first at Allianz Stadium on April 4 then at Newcastle\u2019s McDonald Jones Stadium on April 7.

        "raw_text": "A stunt performer has sued Kevin Costner, alleging she was subjected to an unscripted rape scene without proper warning, consent or protocols while shooting his filmHorizon: An American Saga: Chapter 2. Devyn LaBella filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court. It names Costner \u2013 the director, star and co-writer of theHorizonseries of Westerns \u2013 and its production companies as defendants. \u201cThe impact of this impromptu work demand on Ms LaBella has been profound, not only upending a career Ms LaBella spent years building but leaving her with permanent trauma that she will be required to address for years to come,\u201d the lawsuit says. Costner\u2019s lawyer said the lawsuit had no merit, and LaBella\u2019s assertions were contradicted by the facts and her behaviour. A former gymnast, the 34-year-old LaBella has worked steadily as a Hollywood stunt performer since 2020, with credits includingBarbieandYellowjackets. LaBella\u2019s lawsuit says she was the stunt double for one of theHorizonleads, Ella Hunt, throughout the production. The shoot included a planned sexual assault scene, shot in May 2023, that LaBella performed much of because of its violent and physical nature, the lawsuit says. For that scene, protocols were followed, including meetings, rehearsals, the presence of an intimacy coordinator and minimal crew. But it alleges that the following day, in an unscripted scene with no warning, rehearsal or choreography, Costner directed an actor to pin LaBella down on a wagon and simulate rape. The lawsuit says Costner asked for many takes as he experimented with the violent action and did not make it clear when a shot was beginning or ending. \u201cThere was no escaping the situation, and all Ms LaBella could do was wait for the nightmare to end,\u201d the suit says. It alleges that safeguards were ignored in violation of union contracts and industry standards. Costner\u2019s lawyer, Martin Singer, said while the star wanted everyone to be comfortable on his sets, LaBella\u2019s claim had \u201cabsolutely no merit, and it is completely contradicted by her own actions \u2013 and the facts\u201d. \u201cThe scene in question was explained to Ms LaBella, and after she performed the rehearsal in character with another actor, she gave her stunt co-ordinator supervisor a \u2018thumbs up\u2019 and indicated her willingness to then shoot the scene, if needed (which she was not),\u201d Singer said. \u201cThat night, Ms LaBella had dinner with her supervisor, the stunt coordinator, and with the assistant stunt coordinator, and she was in good spirits and made no complaints to them. She continued to work on the movie for a few more weeks until her wrap date, and she took the stunt co-ordinator to a thank-you dinner.\u201d Singer provided an image of a text message LaBella sent her stunt coordinator at the end of production saying, \u201cThank you for these wonderful weeks!\u201d. Singer said LaBella was \u201ca serial accuser of people in the entertainment industry\u201d. The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as LaBella has done. The lawsuit seeks damages in an amount to be determined at trial. It also seeks a judge\u2019s order for the defendants to undergo sexual harassment training, to be required to use an intimacy co-ordinator on future productions and to issue LaBella a public apology. 1800 RESPECT 1800 737 732 National Sexual Abuse and Redress Support Service 1800 211 028 Lifeline 131 114 Men\u2019s Referral Service 1300 766 491 -AAP",

        "raw_text": "Hugh Jackman has raised eyebrows with a gleeful social media post after his ex-wife, Deborra-Lee Furness, broke her silence on their split. Furness, 69, releaseda scorching statement on Wednesday about the end of her marriage toThe Greatest Showmanactor, 56. The comments came as it was revealed Furness had filed for divorce, formally ending the couple\u2019s 20-year-plus marriage. \u201cMy heart and compassion goes out to everyone who has traversed the traumatic journey of betrayal,\u201d she told the Nine Network. \u201cIt\u2019s a profound wound that cuts deep. However, I believe in a higher power and that God/the universe, whatever you relate to as your guidance, is always working FOR us.\u201d It was Furness\u2019s first public remarks since the Australian couple confirmed their split in a joint statement in September 2023. Only hours later, Jackman posted a video of himself skipping rope on stage as part of his one-man stage showHugh Jackman Live \u2014 From New York with Love. Alongside the clip of a beaming Jackman is his solitary comment: \u201cFINALLY\u201d. The Instagram post to his 34 million followers appeared to be about the performer \u201cfinally\u201d nailing a tricky skipping routine for the show. But what really raised eyebrows was the backing music, NSYNC\u2019s break-up songBye Bye Bye. While Jackman skips on stage, NSYNC\u2019s vocals cut in with the lyrics: \u201cSo I\u2019m leaving you behind, \u201cI don\u2019t want to make it tough, \u201cBut I\u2019ve had enough, \u201cAnd it ain\u2019t no lie, \u201cBye, bye.\u201d Jackman and Furness met on the set of Australian seriesCorrelliin 1995 and married a year later. They share two adult adopted children, son Oscar and daughter Ava. \u201cWe have been blessed to share almost 3 decades together as husband and wife in a wonderful, loving marriage. Our journey now is shifting and we have decided to separate to pursue our individual growth,\u201d they wrote in 2023 to announce their break-up. The statement was signed \u201cDeb and Hugh Jackman\u201d. This week, lawyer Elena Karabatos filed documents in a New York court on behalf of Furness, related to the former couple\u2019s divorce settlement, health care coverage, and medical child support. \u201cThere was some back and forth regarding this financial agreement but, in the end, [Furness] got what she believed she deserved. Both are coming out of this financially secure,\u201d a source told theDaily Mail. \u201cThere is not going to be any drama \u2026 This gives closure that she needed.\u201d TheDaily Mailreports a lengthy deliberation over the division of the former couple\u2019s assets, although no further details about the settlement have been revealed. A judge\u2019s sign off is all that is required to formalise the end of the marriage as the terms of the divorce are uncontested. Furness said she had gained \u201cmuch knowledge and wisdom\u201d in navigating the end of her marriage. \u201cEven when we are presented with apparent adversity, it is leading us to our greatest good, our true purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is so easy to get lost in looking for love and validation outside ourselves, but that\u2019s not where it lives \u2013 it lives within. Sometimes the universe has to create arduous circumstances for us to walk through in order to find our way home, back to our true essence and the sovereignty of self love.\u201d She said she had found \u201cliberation and freedom\u201d post-split and was \u201cgrateful\u201d for her life path. \u201cIt can hurt, but in the long run, returning to yourself and living within your own integrity, values and boundaries is liberation and freedom,\u201d she said. \u201cOne thing I have learned is that none of this is personal, we are all on our individual journeys and I believe that the relationships in our lives are not random. \u201cWe are drawn to people, we invite them in, in order to learn our lessons and to recognise and heal the broken parts of ourselves.\u201d She finished: \u201cI remain grateful.\u201d Since the couple\u2019s split, Furness has been spotted attending numerous events solo. She was also at the Australian Open in Melbourne with daughter Ava earlier this year. WolverineandDeadpoolstar Jackman, meanwhile, was been repeatedly linked with fellow actor Sutton Foster, 50. She was his co-star in Broadway\u2019sMusic Manand divorced her own husband, Ted Griffin, in late 2024. Jackman and Foster were first romantically linked in late 2023 \u2013 just two months after he and Furness split. \u201cThey are 100 per cent together and are in love and want to spend the rest of their lives together,\u201d a source toldPage Six.",

        "raw_text": "Scientists have designed a fuel cell they say could deliver three times as much energy per unit of weight as existing lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. Unlike a battery, the liquid sodium-air device needs only to be refuelled, not recharged. Luckily, sodium (a constituent of table salt) is inexpensive and one of the most abundant elements on Earth. The researchers envision a fully developed version of the technology could help electrify hard-to-decarbonise transport systems, such as aircraft, ships, and trains. The chemical reaction also produces useful sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as a discharge product, which could be saved and used commercially as caustic soda. Crucially, NaOH has another property: It readily combines with carbon dioxide (CO2) to form sodium carbonate, which in turn forms sodium bicarbonate or baking soda. NaOH has been explored as a potential vehicle for carbon capture and use (CCU). But its high cost and carbon footprint associated with production have remained barriers to widespread adoption. In an enclosed system, the researchers envision NaOH could be retained and later used to capture and sequester CO2 from point sources. In an open system, such as on an aircraft, NaOH could instead be discharged during operation to combine with CO2 in the atmosphere. If the resulting sodium bicarbonate ends up in the ocean, the researchers say it would help towards deacidifying it to counter another damaging effect of CO2. \u201cWe expect people to think that this is a totally crazy idea,\u201d said Yet-Ming Chiang, senior author of the study and professor of Materials Science and Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be a bit disappointed because if people don\u2019t think something is totally crazy at first, it probably isn\u2019t going to be that revolutionary. \u201cPeople have been aware of the energy density you could get with metal-air batteries for a very long time, and it\u2019s been hugely attractive, but it\u2019s just never been realised in practice.\u201d In their study published in the journalJoule, Chiang and colleagues outline the production of two lab-scale prototypes of their new system. In the H cell prototype, two vertical glass tubes are connected by a tube across the middle. Liquid sodium metal fills the tube on one side and humid air flows through the other. The connecting horizontal tube contains a solid ceramic electrolyte, which allows sodium ions to pass freely through, and a porous air-facing electrode that helps the sodium to chemically react with oxygen to produce electricity. The other prototype uses a horizontal design, with a tray of the electrolyte material holding the liquid sodium fuel. The porous air electrode, which facilitates the reaction, is in the bottom of the tray. Tests using an air stream with a carefully controlled humidity level produced nearly 1700 watt-hours per kilogram at the level of an individual \u201cstack. Chiang said that would translate to more than 1000 watt-hours at the full system level. \u201cThe threshold that you really need for realistic electric aviation is about 1000 watt-hours per kilogram,\u201d he said. Reaching this, he said, would enable electric aviation for regional flights, which account for about 80 per cent of domestic flights and 30 per cent of emissions from aviation. The technology could be an enabler for other sectors as well, including marine and rail transportation. \u201cThey all require very high energy density, and they all require low cost,\u201d Chiang said. \u201cThat\u2019s what attracted us to sodium metal.\u201d While the prototype is a small, single cell, Chiang said the system should be quite straightforward to scale up to practical sizes for commercialisation. Members of the research team have formed a company, Propel Aero, to further develop the technology. This article was first published inCosmos. Read the original here",

        "raw_text": "A 50-year extension to the North West Shelf (NWS) project in Western Australia would see huge amounts of gas given away with no return for Australians. While the exact volume and value is hard to predict, a basic estimate is that up to $215 billion worth of gas could be given away, royalty-free. The NWS liquefied natural gas facility, specifically the Karratha Gas Plant, producers up to 18.6 mega tonnes of LNG each year. At present, it sources around 75 per cent of its natural gas from the royalty-paying NWS gas fields off the coast of WA. These fields are the only major offshore gas project in WA that pays royalties, all others are royalty-free as the Commonwealth Government chooses not to charge a price for the public\u2019s gas. As we\u2019vepointed out before, the proponents of the NWS extension, Woodside, have not identified where all the gas will come from with major implications for WA gas prices. What is clear is that the royalty-paying NWS gas that feeds the Karratha Gas Plant is forecast to decline and it will increasingly be fed by gas from non-royalty paying reserves such as the Browse Basin, as shown in this chart that we first published here.  As shown in the above chart, it is possible that by 2036, none of the gas feeding the Karratha Gas Plant would be coming from royalty-paying reserves, although some gas could be sourced from Waitsia and other onshore or state-waters sources that would pay a royalty. Below, we conservatively assume that that 70 per cent of Karratha Gas Plant feedstock gas is royalty-free by the mid-2030s, and a price of $8 per gigajoule for gas, which is now common in WA wholesale trades. On these assumptions, the NWS shelf extension will be receiving around $5.1 billion a year in royalty-free gas, or $14 million each day, or $215 billion over the project\u2019s 46-year life. These calculations are shown in Table 1.  Across the 46-year extension of the project, a total $215 billion in free gas will be given away. For comparison, the output of the entire WA economy was $448 billion in 2024. Matt Saunders is a senior economist and Rod Campbell is research director at theAustralia Institute.",

        "raw_text": "A controversial gas project has been given the green light to keep operating for decades to come, provoking an angry response from environmental groups. New federal Environment Minister Murray Watt on Wednesday approved fossil fuel giant Woodside\u2019s proposal to extend its North West Shelf project in Western Australia. The approval, which allows Woodside to extend the project\u2019s life from 2030 to 2070, is subject to strict conditions about the impact of air emission levels from the expanded onshore gas plant at Karratha. The energy company has 10 business days to respond to the proposed decision. Watt said he would consider the response before a final decision was made. The impact of air emissions on the Murujuga rock art that forms part of the Dampier Archipelago was considered as part of the assessment process, he said. \u201cI have ensured that adequate protection for the rock art is central to my proposed decision,\u201d he said. Woodside\u2019s proposal to extend the operating life of the project has been under assessment for six years. The decision came after the release of a report indicating the United Nations will reject Australia\u2019s bid to add the Murujuga rock art to the World Heritage list. Its integrity was \u201cvulnerable due to industrial emissions, considered the majorly adversely affecting factor for the petroglyphs\u201d, the International Council on Monuments and Sites determined in its report to UNESCO. An agenda for UNESCO\u2019s meeting in July shows the draft decision will be deferred and the nomination sent back to the Australian government to address the risks to World Heritage values, including \u201cthe total removal of degrading acidic emissions currently impacting upon the petroglyphs\u201d. Australian Conservation Foundation climate campaigner Piper Rollins said the report \u201cclearly identified\u201d the North West Shelf gas hub as the primary risk to the ancient rock art. \u201cUNESCO is essentially saying to the Albanese government: you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it. You are going to have to choose between World Heritage or Woodside\u2019s toxic gas extension,\u201d she said. \u201cThe two cannot co-exist.\u201d Greenpeace Australia chief executive David Ritter said Watt\u2019s \u201cterrible decision\u201d brought Woodside\u2019s destructive gas drills one step closer to Scott Reef, a marine ecosystem that is home to threatened species such as pygmy blue whales and green sea turtles. \u201cThe North West Shelf facility is one of Australia\u2019s dirtiest and most polluting fossil fuel projects,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Albanese government\u2019s next decision on whether or not to approve Woodside\u2019s Browse proposal will show Australians the true colours of the government. We urge Minister Watt to stand up for nature and oceans and reject Woodside plans to drill at Scott Reef.\u201d Independent senator Lidia Thorpe said Watt\u2019s decision \u201ccould ignite a climate bomb\u201d and permanently destroy sacred sites, but he hadn\u2019t consulted traditional custodians and had ignored a heritage protection application lodged more than three years ago. \u201cThere is no way to justify this project \u2013 not when it will release billions of tonnes of emissions, not when we\u2019re watching Murujuga\u2019s sacred rock art being erased by pollution, and not when communities are suffering the impacts of climate collapse,\u201d Thorpe said. Watt flew to WA to meet stakeholders but refused to meet Murujuga custodians, she said. \u201cChoosing Reconciliation Week to push through this decision, while side-lining First Peoples, is not just disrespectful \u2013 it\u2019s disgraceful,\u201d she said. Watt, whose reputation as a dealmaker led to his shift into the environment portfolio, had promised to reach a decision on the extension by May 31. The federal government twice delayed a final decision until after the election, following approval from the WA government. Traditional owners have raised concerns about the impact of the expanded project on sacred rock art and launched legal action to try to compel Watt to protect the artwork. Research released by the Australia Institute showed that emissions from the planned extension would be equivalent to 33 years of Australia\u2019s entire emissions. -AAP",

        "raw_text": "Another SpaceX Starship rocket has spun out of control mid-flight without achieving some of its most important testing goals. The 122-metre Starship rocket system, the core of Musk\u2019s goal of sending humans to Mars, lifted off from SpaceX\u2019s Starbase, Texas, launch site on Tuesday (local time). It flew beyond the point of two previous explosive attempts earlier this year that sent debris streaking over Caribbean islands and forced dozens of airliners to divert course. For the latest launch, the ninth full test mission of Starship since the first attempt in April 2023, the upper-stage cruise vessel was lofted to space atop a previously flown booster \u2013 a first such demonstration of the booster\u2019s reusability. But SpaceX lost contact with the lower-stage booster during its descent before it plunged into the sea, rather than making the controlled splashdown the company had planned. Starship, meanwhile, continued into suborbital space before it began to spin uncontrollably roughly half an hour into the mission. The errant spiralling came after SpaceX cancelled a plan to deploy eight mock Starlink satellites into space. Tuesday\u2019s failed flight brings fresh engineering hurdles to CEO Elon Musk\u2019s increasingly turbulent Mars rocket program. Musk was scheduled to deliver an update on his space exploration ambitions in a speech from Starbase following the test flight. Hours later, he had yet to appear and there was no sign that he intended to do so. In a post on X, Musk touted Starship\u2019s scheduled shutdown of an engine in space, a step previous test flights achieved last year. Musk said a leak on Starship\u2019s primary fuel tank led to its loss of control. \u201cLot of good data to review,\u201d he said. \u201cLaunch cadence for next 3 flights will be faster, at approximately 1 every 3 to 4 weeks.\u201d SpaceX has said the Starship models that have flown this year bear significant design upgrades from previous prototypes, as thousands of company employees work to build a multi-purpose rocket capable of putting massive batches of satellites in space, carrying humans back to the moon and ultimately ferrying astronauts to Mars. In issuing approval for Tuesday\u2019s test, the US Federal Aviation Administration said it had nearly doubled the airspace closure zone to 2963 kilometres east of the launch site. The Starship test involved co-ordination with authorities in Britain, the British-controlled Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, Mexico and Cuba, according to a media report. The Starship rocket system was first tested in April 2023, when it completely exploded after just a few minutes. In subsequent tests, the upper stage reached space and even landed in a controlled manner in the Indian Ocean. -AAP",

        "raw_text": "Deborra-Lee Furness has released a scorching statement about the end of her marriage toThe Greatest ShowmanHugh Jackman. The comments were the first public remarks from Furness, 69, or 56-year-old Jackman in more than two years since they confirmed their split in a joint statement in September 2023. It came as it was revealed that Furness had filed for divorce, formally ending the couple\u2019s 20-year-plus marriage. \u201cMy heart and compassion goes out to everyone who has traversed the traumatic journey of betrayal,\u201d she told the Nine Network. \u201cIt\u2019s a profound wound that cuts deep. However, I believe in a higher power and that God/the universe, whatever you relate to as your guidance, is always working FOR us.\u201d Jackman and Furness met on the set of Australian seriesCorrelliin 1995 and married a year later. They share two adult adopted children, son Oscar and daughter Ava. \u201cWe have been blessed to share almost 3 decades together as husband and wife in a wonderful, loving marriage.Our journey now is shifting and we have decided to separate to pursue our individual growth,\u201d they wrote in 2023 to announce their break-up. The statement was signed \u201cDeb and Hugh Jackman\u201d. This week, lawyer Elena Karabatos filed documents in a New York court on behalf of Furness, related to the former couple\u2019s divorce settlement, health care coverage, and medical child support. \u201cThere was some back and forth regarding this financial agreement but, in the end, [Furness] got what she believed she deserved. Both are coming out of this financially secure,\u201d a source told theDaily Mail. \u201cThere is not going to be any drama \u2026 This gives closure that she needed.\u201d TheDaily Mailreports a lengthy deliberation over the division of the former couple\u2019s assets, although no further details about the settlement have been revealed. A judge\u2019s sign off is all that is required to formalise the end of the marriage as the terms of the divorce are uncontested. Furness said she had gained \u201cmuch knowledge and wisdom\u201d in navigating the end of her marriage. \u201cEven when we are presented with apparent adversity, it is leading us to our greatest good, our true purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is so easy to get lost in looking for love and validation outside ourselves, but that\u2019s not where it lives \u2013 it lives within. Sometimes the universe has to create arduous circumstances for us to walk through in order to find our way home, back to our true essence and the sovereignty of self love.\u201d She said she had found \u201cliberation and freedom\u201d post-split and was \u201cgrateful\u201d for her life path. \u201cIt can hurt, but in the long run, returning to yourself and living within your own integrity, values and boundaries is liberation and freedom,\u201d she said. \u201cOne thing I have learned is that none of this is personal, we are all on our individual journeys and I believe that the relationships in our lives are not random. \u201cWe are drawn to people, we invite them in, in order to learn our lessons and to recognise and heal the broken parts of ourselves.\u201d She finished: \u201cI remain grateful.\u201d Since the couple\u2019s split, Furness has been spotted attending numerous events solo. She was also at the Australian Open in Melbourne with daughter Ava earlier this year. WolverineandDeadpoolstar Jackman, meanwhile, was been repeatedly linkedwith fellow actor Sutton Foster, 50. She was his co-star in Broadway\u2019sMusic Manand divorced her own husband, Ted Griffin, in late 2024. Jackman and Foster were first romantically linked in late 2023 \u2013 just two months after he and Furness split. \u201cThey are 100 per cent together and are in love and want to spend the rest of their lives together,\u201d a source toldPage Six.",

        "raw_text": "Bono was jubilant and emotional at the Cannes premiere of his highly personal documentaryBono: Stories of Surrender, holding his wife Alison Hewson\u2019s hand and thanking his four children and his U2 bandmates and manager Paul McGuinness, for a life well lived. \u201cYou wrote this story,\u201d he said. Naming daughters Jordan and Eve and sons Jordan and Elijah, he noted: \u201cYou wrote the story and you continue to write your own story. I\u2019m very proud of you. The Edge (Dave Evans) wrote this story, Adam (Clayton, bassist) and Larry (Mullen Jr, drums) wrote this story. McGuinness wrote this story. We\u2019re still writing it \u2013 it\u2019s still a work in progress.\u201d Born Paul Hewson in 1960 in Dublin, Bono had initially written a 2022 memoir,Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story. To mark its publication the U2 frontman devised a one-man show described as \u201can evening of words, music and some mischief\u201d and embarked on a tour of intimate gigs throughout the US and Europe. In 2023 he teamed up with Australian director Andrew Dominik to recreate a filmed version of the show at New York\u2019s historic Beacon Theatre. Apart from a dynamic closing moment, Dominik shotStories of Surrenderin black-and-white as he did with 2016\u2019sOne More Time With Feeling,focusing on Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds. (Dominik also collaborated with Cave on 2022\u2019sThis Much I Know to be True,which was largely shot in black-and-white and drew on the death of Cave\u2019s son Arthur.)  Bono saysStories of Surrender, which he co-wrote with Bill Flanagan, is an attempt to cast off the mask of fame and reveal his true self. We see the singer, dressed in a black jacket, black pants and orange-tinted glasses, perform songs and tell of his life, recalling his mother Iris\u2019s death from a brain aneurysm when he was 14 and his fractured relationship with his hard-to-please opera-loving father, Brendan, a wannabe singer. Bono\u2019s saving grace was meeting Alison, whom he\u2019d known since they were 12. They got together three years later.\u201cShe was a 15-year-old girl who had faith in me, she encouraged my dreams,\u201d he says. Incredibly, he notes how he joined up with guitarist Dave Evans (Edge), bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr to form U2 in the same week. The band would achieve huge success, selling 170 million albums and winning a record-breaking 22 Grammys. In 1983 U2 had a huge hit with the politically chargedSunday Bloody Sunday,focusing on the violence in Northern Ireland. Two years later they sang at Live Aid, which raised US$250 million to feed starving refugees in Africa. \u201cWhere you live should not decide whether you live,\u201d he says in the show. \u201cLives matter, justice matters.\u201d While he admits to being overpaid and overfed \u2013\u201dhypocrites get a bad rap\u201d, he muses \u2013 he recalls the difficulties in his life. In 2016 a congenital heart condition almost killed him, but then the film becomes about his father. He left home at an early age to escape him. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I forgive my father. Surrender does not come easy,\u201d he says. But then Bono wonders if their fractured relationship was his fault. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could be a father because I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d been much of a son.\u201d In any case he says, \u201cI craved my father\u2019s attention and he didn\u2019t hear me, so I sang louder and louder.\u201d Bono now recognises that his father was grieving and was unable to support him through his mother\u2019s death. His father would not even mention her death in their Dublin home. He recalls his brother Norman giving him a guitar. \u201cI was singing Ramones\u2019 songs in the living room around my 18thbirthday and all my Da (father) wanted to talk to me about was getting a job. He didn\u2019t want to know about rock and roll.\u201d Later in life he would meet his father on Sundays in a Dublin pub. By this time Bono was famous and while he could recognise his father\u2019s pride\u00a0 \u2013 \u201cI heard your songPrideon the radio the other day and I might have felt some\u201d, he recalls his father saying \u2013he notes how he was only able to see him as a friend after his death from cancer in 2001. Still, he has some fond memories like when his father Brendan, an anti-royalist, met Princess Diana and was star struck.\u201cEight centuries of oppression melted away in eight seconds!\u201d Bono chortles. Bono\u2019s activism is also dealt with in the film and he later told one interviewer: \u201cYou know, even the change, the world stuff, comes back to me trying to impress my father. \u201cNow here I am with stories of surrender. The word surrender sounds preposterous in a moment when it seems like the planet is determined to set fire to itself. We\u2019re closer to a world war than at any time in my life. We have to evolve past violence. So that\u2019s my position, and I held it when I was 23 and was laughed and mocked. That\u2019s okay. John Lennon was prepared to look ridiculous for peace.\u201d At the Cannes premiere, Bono commended Plan B for producing the documentary. \u201cI want to thank Brad Pitt for not showing up, because he would steal the show,\u201d he said with a chuckle. He also addressed the late Steve Jobs, the Apple founder whose company helped finance the film. \u201cI visited Steve Jobs down the coast not so long ago and he was a man who had grown such a gigantic company. You treated me so tenderly. Imagine (Apple) paying for us to go to Italy to shoot that fantasy scene about my father.\u201d Bono also thanked Sean Penn, who was in the audience and had brought Ukrainian soldiers to the ceremony. \u201cIf I was in the trenches, like real trenches, as opposed to ones on a movie set, I\u2019d want to be with Sean Penn in those trenches,\u201d Bono said. He also thanked the musicians on stage, cellist Kate Ellis and harpist Gemma Doherty, who breathe fresh life into U2 hits includingSunday Bloody Sunday, Beautiful DayandPride (In the Name of Love). Lastly, Bono thanked director Andrew Dominik: \u201cOh my, he\u2019s not here, he\u2019s working,\u201d Bono said, attempting an Australian accent. \u201cAndrew, I love your vision, and I can\u2019t believe you got those performances out of me and thank you for that.\u201d Bono: Stories of Surrenderstreams on Apple TV+ from May 30.",

        "raw_text": "Emergency rooms across Australia are noticing a spike in children\u2019s flu admissions, as a survey reveals one in six kids are unvaccinated. Melbourne\u2019s Royal Children\u2019s Hospital has had a 27 per cent increase in flu cases compared to the previous year, with many unvaccinated children requiring hospitalisation. The survey of almost 2000 parents revealed 36 per cent were unaware healthy children could get seriously unwell from the flu. The hospital\u2019s national child health poll found 17 per cent of children would not be vaccinated against the flu this year, with some 22 per cent of parents still unsure whether they would vaccinate their kids. National Child Health Poll director Anthea Rhodes said the research showed significant knowledge gaps among parents about the flu. \u201cUnfortunately, it means parents are unintentionally putting their kids at risk because they don\u2019t have the right health information,\u201d she said. The research also found hesitant parents were twice as likely to say they did not know where to find trustworthy flu vaccine information online and three times as likely to distrust information from their child\u2019s doctor or nurse. Rhodes said this could be due to vaccine fatigue that had arisen since the Covid-19 pandemic. But she said it was important to remember that vaccination cut the risk of catching the flu by 50 to 60 per cent and significantly reduced the severity of the illness. She said even healthy children could get complications of heart, kidney and brain inflammation if not vaccinated against the flu. The survey found one in six children had a needle phobia so intense their parents reported it prevented them from getting vaccinated. Others said the vaccine was too costly or they just didn\u2019t have the time. Rhodes said while programs through local councils and GPs were available, more research was needed to investigate whether the flu vaccine could be introduced to the school immunisation rollout. \u201cIn the UK, for example, they do have school-based programs where they have an intranasal flu vaccine product,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the main challenges for Australia to date has been getting that product available to enable delivery in schools, because the flu strain changes each season. \u201cBut certainly in the future we are continuing to work towards solutions like that would be a really big game changer for families when it comes to the flu.\u201d It is not too late to vaccinate, she said. In Victoria, flu vaccinations are free for children until they turn five. Older family members can generally receive the vaccine for low cost. Western Australia and Queensland offer free flu vaccinations for all age groups but this initiative has not been adopted nationwide. -AAP",

        "raw_text": "A sprinkle of cinnamon on your porridge, a pinch of turmeric in your curry, or a dash of ginger in your biscuits \u2013 these popular spices are kitchen staples around the world. For centuries, spices haven\u2019t just been used to flavour food but also valued in traditional Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine fortheir healing properties. But could something as innocent as a spoonful of spice interfere with your medication? Take cinnamon, for example. Sourced from the bark of Cinnamomum trees, it contains active compounds like cinnamaldehyde, eugenol and coumarin. Cinnamon oil, derived from the bark or leaves, is often used in food flavouring, fragrances and herbal remedies. Cinnamon has been linked to a range of potential health benefits: It\u2019s rich in antioxidants, it may reduce inflammation, it helpsregulate blood sugar levels, itlowers the riskof heart disease, and even improves brain function. Traditionally, it\u2019s also been usedto ease digestionand ward off infections. Buta recent studyfrom the University of Mississippi has raised concerns that cinnamon could reduce the effectiveness of certain medications. In lab tests, cinnamaldehyde was found to activate receptors that speed up how drugs are cleared from the body \u2013 potentially making them less effective. While this research is still in the early stages and hasn\u2019t yet been tested in humans, it raises important questions about how cinnamon interacts with modern medicines. The type of cinnamon matters too. The cinnamon commonly found in supermarkets \u2013 cassia cinnamon \u2013 is cheaper, widely available and comes from parts of Asia. Ceylon cinnamon, often labelled as \u201ctrue cinnamon,\u201d originates from Sri Lanka and is generally more expensive. Cassia cinnamon contains higher levels of coumarin, a natural compound that can harm the liver in high doses,according to studies.Coumarin is also aknown anti-coagulant, meaning it helps prevent blood clots, which is useful in medicine but risky when combined with blood-thinning drugs like warfarin. There have beena few case reportssuggesting that cinnamon supplements could increase the risk of bleeding when taken with anti-coagulants. This is probably due to coumarin affecting liver enzymes responsible for breaking down drugs like warfarin. Some researchalso suggests cinnamon could potentially interact with other medications, including painkillers, anti-depressants, anti-cancer drugs and diabetes medications. But before you throw out your spice rack, it\u2019s important to remember: The risks come from high doses, particularly in supplement form. A light sprinkle of cinnamon on your porridge is unlikely to cause problems. Another spice with medicinal promise \u2013 and potential risks \u2013is turmeric. Known for its vivid yellow colour and use in both cooking and traditional medicine, turmeric contains curcumin, a compound praised for its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects. However, information on turmeric\u2019s interactions with medications is still limited. Most of what we know comes from lab and animal studies, which don\u2019t always translate directly to humans. Still, there\u2019s evidence that curcumin can affect how some drugs are metabolised, particularly by interfering with liver enzymes. This means it couldpotentially interactwith anti-depressants, blood pressure medications, chemotherapy drugs and certain antibiotics. Turmeric also has natural blood-thinning properties, whichcould amplifythe effects of medications like warfarin or aspirin.Animal studies suggestturmeric may also lower blood sugar, meaning it could increase the effects of anti-diabetic drugs or insulin. Additionally, turmeric has been shown toreduce blood pressure, which, when combined with blood pressure medications, could cause an excessive drop. As with cinnamon, these effects are most often linked to high dose supplements, not the small amounts used in food. Ginger is another spice celebrated for its health benefits, particularly its anti-nausea and anti-inflammatory effects. But its active compounds,including gingerol, may also influence how your body handles medications. Ginger can act as a mild blood thinner, which means combining it with anti-coagulants could raise the risk of bleeding. Theevidence is mixedwhen it comes to ginger and diabetes: Whilesome studies suggestit may lower blood sugar, more research is needed to fully understand the effect it may have when taken alongside anti-diabetic medications. While lab studies suggest these spices may affect how the body processes certain medications, the vast majority of these effects have been observed in high doses \u2013usually from supplements, not everyday cooking. If you\u2019re taking medications, especially blood thinners, diabetes medicines, or chemotherapy drugs, it\u2019s worth having a quick chat with your doctor or pharmacist before starting any new herbal supplements. But for most people, using spices in typical culinary amounts is safe \u2013 and a delicious way to add both flavour and potential health benefits to your meals. So go ahead: Sprinkle, pinch, or dash \u2013 just be mindful of what\u2019s in your medicine cabinet \u2013 and be wary of taking any herbal supplement in high doses.

Sandilands has told listeners of his Kyle & Jackie O Show that he\u2019s heading into movies \u2013 with a cameo role in the upcoming filmZombie Plane. The 53-year-old will play himself alongside a star-studded cast that includes Chuck Norris, Sir Bob Geldof, Ice T and Brian Austin Green. \u201cA Sydney to LA flight is taken over by zombies and an eclectic group of high-profile passengers, led by celebrities turned secret agents, must band together to fight to save humanity. Have you ever heard of a better plot ever?\u201d he said during Monday morning\u2019s broadcast. \u201cI\u2019m actually picking out my Oscars outfit now \u2026 we\u2019ll be going to Cannes, probably. We\u2019ll be going to all the film festivals. Probably. Move over, Leo. You\u2019ve had your turn. It\u2019s Sandilands\u2019 turn.\u201d He described the film as \u201cSnakes on a Plane, but with zombies,\u201d \u201cHave you ever heard of a better plot?\u201d Sandilands asked co-host Jackie Henderson. \u201cIt\u2019s a big budget. Real sets. No green screen. I\u2019m actually out on the water on a super yacht.\u201d Other Australians among the star-studded cast will include Stephen Curry, Natalie Bassingwaithe, Cody Simpson, Matt Okine, John Jarratt and Amy Shark. Sandilands\u2019 character will apparently be a larger than life version of himself. He will smoke cigars, sip whisky and lounge aboard a luxury vessel before Ice-T turns up to enlist his help with a critical \u201cinstrumentation situation.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m playing myself as a very rich man on a super yacht,\u201d he said. \u201cThen a big American submarine pops you and out pops Ice T, who\u2019s in charge of the submarine, and I\u2019ve got to help them. I don\u2019t think I have a lot of dialogue.\u201d The sidestep into cinema comes as Sandilands and Henderson continue to battle poor ratings in their shift into the competitive Melbourne breakfast radio market. It followed their record-breaking $200 million deal with Australian Radio Network signed in November 2023. Under the 10-year deal, the pair each earns $10 million a year. But they have struggled to make any real impact in the Victorian capital. In early May, the most recent ratings had them as the seventh most popular breakfast radio show, with a 5.8 per cent share (up 0.7 per cent on the previous survey) of listeners. Ahead of those ratings, Sandilands launched into a explosive rant on air, threatening to\u00a0\u201c[pull] the carpet out\u201d in Melbourne \u201cif we don\u2019t rate better by the end of the year\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s get one thing right here, and I\u2019ve told our management this. We\u2019re not going to super serve Melbourne and ignore our Sydney audience. You either glue on in Melbourne or you \u2014-.

The 76-year-old musicianhas revealed being diagnosed with a condition called normal pressure hydrocephalus, which has caused problems with his hearing, vision and balance. \u201cBilly Joel has announced that he will be cancelling all scheduled concerts following a recent diagnosis of Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus . This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance,\u201d a statement posted on his Instagram read. Joel\u2019s diagnosis, revealed at the weekend, came months after he stumbled and fell during a concert at Mohegan Sun in Connecticut in February. Doctors have told him that performing during his treatment would would have an adverse affect on his health. \u201cUnder his doctor\u2019s instructions, Billy is undergoing physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period. Billy is thankful for the excellent care he is receiving and is fully committed to prioritising his health. He is grateful for the support from fans during this time and looks forward to the day when he can once again take the stage,\u201d the statement said. Joel added his own message to fans, saying: \u201cI\u2019m sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience, and thank you for understanding.\u201d Normal pressure hydrocephalus happens when cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the skull and presses on the brain, according to clevelandclinic.org. It says it is most likely in people aged over 65 and \u201coften treatable and sometimes even reversible\u201d. Joel subsequently cancelled his tour, which included 17 dates in North America and England. The tour was initially scheduled to start in February but had already been delayed until July, due to an undisclosed medical condition. Alexa Ray, whose mother is model Christie Brinkley, has since provided an update on her father\u2019s progress. She captioned a painting of a father and daughter on Instagram: \u201cSOUND UP.

        "summary": "",
        "raw_text": "Last week, Australia\u2019sTherapeutic Goods Administrationapproved a drug called donanemab for people in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Donanemab has previously been approved in a number of other countries, includingthe United States. So what is donanemab, and who will be able to access it in Australia? There are more than 100 different causesof dementia, but Alzheimer\u2019s disease alone accounts for about 70 per cent of these, making itthe most common formof dementia. The disease is believed to be caused by the accumulation in the brain of two abnormal proteins, amyloid and tau. The first is thought to be particularly important, and the \u201camyloid hypothesis\u201d \u2013 which suggests amyloid is the key cause of Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2013 has driven research for many years. Donanemab is a \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d treatment. Antibodies are proteins the immune system produces that bind to harmful foreign \u201cinvaders\u201d in the body, or targets. A monoclonal antibody has one specific target. In the case of donanemab it\u2019s the amyloid protein. Donanemab binds to amyloid protein deposits (plaques) in the brain and allows our bodies to remove them. Donanemab is given monthly, via intravenous infusion. Australia\u2019s approval of donanemab comes as a result of aclinical trialinvolving 1736 people published in 2023. This trial showed donanemab brought a significant slowing of disease progression in a group of patients who had either early Alzheimer\u2019s disease, or mild cognitive impairment with signs of Alzheimer\u2019s pathology. Before entering the trial, all patients had the presence of amyloid protein detected viaPET scanning. Participants were randomised, and half received donanemab, while the other half received a placebo, over 18 months. For those who received the active drug, their Alzheimer\u2019s disease progressed 35 per cent more slowly over 18 months compared to those who were given the placebo. The researchers ascertained this using the Integrated Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Rating Scale, which measures cognition and function. Those who received donanemab also demonstrated large reductions in the levels of amyloid in the brain (as measured by PET scans). The majority, by the end of the trial, were considered to be below the threshold that would normally indicate the presence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. These results certainly seem to vindicate the amyloid hypothesis, which had beencalled into questionby the results of multiplefailed previous studies. They represent a major advance in our understanding of the disease. That said, patients in the study did notimprovein terms of cognition or function. They continued to decline, albeit at a significantly slower rate than those who were not treated. The actual clinical significance has beena topic of debate. Some experts have questioned whether the meaningfulness of this result to the patient is worth the potential risks. Some 24 per cent of trial participants receiving the drug experienced brain swelling. The rates rose to 40.6 per cent in those possessing two copies of a gene called ApoE4. Although three-quarters of people who developed brain swelling experienced no symptoms from this, there were three deaths in the treatment group during the study related to donanemab, likely a result of brain swelling. These risksrequire regular monitoringwith MRI scans while the drug is being given. Some 26.8 per cent of those who received donanemab also experienced small bleeds into the brain (microhaemorrhages) compared to 12.5 per cent of those taking the placebo. Reports indicate donanemab could cost anywhere between$40,000-$80,000each year in Australia. This puts it beyond the reach of many who might benefit from it. Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of donanemab, has applied for the drug to be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, with a decision pending perhaps withina couple of months. While this would make the drug substantially more affordable for patients, it will represent a large cost to taxpayers. The cost of the drug is in addition to costs associated with the monitoring required to ensure its safety and efficacy (such as doctor visits, MRIs and PET scans). This drug is of benefit only for people with early Alzheimer\u2019s-type dementia, so not everybody with Alzheimer\u2019s disease will get access to it. Almost 80 per cent of people who were screened to participatein the trialwere found unsuitable to proceed. The terms of theTGA approvalspecify potential patients will first need to be found to have specific levels of amyloid protein in their brains. This would be ascertained either by PET scanning or by lumbar puncture sampling of spinal fluid. Also, patients with two copies of the ApoE4 gene have been ruled unsuitable to receive the drug. The TGA has judged the risk/benefit profile for this group to be unfavourable. This genetic profile accounts for only 2 per cent of the general population, but15 per cent of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It\u2019s estimated more than400,000 Australianshave dementia. But only13 per cent of peoplewith dementia currently receive a diagnosis within a year of developing symptoms. Given those with very early disease stand to benefit most from this treatment, we need to expand our dementia diagnostic services significantly. Finally, expectations need to be tempered about what this drug can reasonably achieve. It\u2019s important to be mindful this is not a cure.

        "raw_text": "A few years ago, asocial media trendchallenged people to see if they could stand up from the floor without using their hands. Now, it\u2019s all about how long you canbalance on one legwhile brushing your teeth. These quirky \u201ctests\u201d promise to tell us how well we\u2019re ageing \u2013 but do they really? When we talk about \u201cageing well\u201d, we\u2019re usually referring to both physical and psychological wellbeing. That includes feeling good (hedonic wellbeing) and finding meaning and purpose (eudaimonic wellbeing). Engaging in activities and monitoring ourselves plays a role in both. But ageingisn\u2019t just abouthow strong your grip is or how fast you can walk. It\u2019sa complex mixof physical, cognitive, emotional and social changes \u2013 and no single test captures the whole picture. Physically, one simple measure that gets a lot of attention is walking speed. According toone famous study, people who walk faster than 1.32 metres a second were less likely to die in the next three years \u2013 jokingly framed as \u201ctoo fast for the Grim Reaper to catch\u201d. On the flip side, a slower walking speed \u2013 below 0.8 metres per second \u2013 can be asign of sarcopenia, a condition involving reduced muscle mass, muscle strength and physical function. These are all important indicators of age-related decline. But while these markers are useful, they\u2019re not easy to measure at home. Most research relies on specialist equipment and your local GP probably doesn\u2019t have a grip-strength dynamometer sitting in a drawer. But they could timehow long it takes you to stand up and sit down five times from a chair. So, what can you realistically do to track your own ageing? To truly understand how you\u2019re ageing, it helps to think beyond physical health. Mental sharpness, emotional resilience and social connection matter just as much. One helpful idea is to assess your cognitive fitness, which includes skills like attention, memory and flexibility. Here are some cognitive tests you can try at home: Trail making test:Connect numbers and letters in sequence (1, A, 2, B, etc.) and time how long it takes. This measures your ability to switch between tasks. Stroop task:Challenges your ability to ignore competing information. Try saying the colour of a word, not the word itself \u2013 like saying \u201cred\u201d when you see the word \u201cblue\u201d printed in red ink. It\u2019s harder than it sounds! Dual-task challenge:Walk at your normal speed while counting backwards from 100 in threes. If your walking speed changes significantly, it could indicate cognitive strain. These kinds of tasks test how well your brain handles competing demands \u2013 a key ability that becomes even more important as we age. This skill is known ascognitive flexibility, and it helps you adapt to changing situations, switch between tasks and manage distractions. Trying out these tests is great, but how do you know if you\u2019re improving? After all, when you have spent time trying to improve your walking speed, or Stroop ability \u2013 or even rubbing your head, patting your belly while saying the Finnish alphabet out loud \u2013 it\u2019s important to know if you are seeing benefits. Some measures, like single-leg stance,can varywildly from day to day \u2013 or even hour to hour. You might get better just from repeating it, which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re ageing better, just that you\u2019ve practised. Others,like grip strength, change very slowly even with regular strength training. And some improvements are task-specific: Getting better at the trail making test doesn\u2019t necessarily make you sharper at doing Wordle. That\u2019s why it helps to complete the test a few times at the start, then retest yourself once a month or so \u2013 again, doing it a couple of times \u2013 to track any improvements. Cognitive changes may be slower to notice than physical ones, so regular checks can help reveal progress over time. There\u2019s no single test or score that can capture how well you\u2019re ageing. Think of it more like a jigsaw puzzle. Physical health, mental agility, emotional balance, social connection \u2013they all matter, and they all interact. And, of course, even if you perform well now, some changes in the future may be beyond your control. No test can fully predict what lies ahead. At the end of the day, maybe the best sign of ageing well isn\u2019t how fast you walk or how long you can stand on one leg \u2013 it\u2019s how you feel about your life. Are you feeling engaged, content, connected? Tools like theScale of Positive and Negative Experiencecan help you take stock of your emotional wellbeing. This short,12-question surveyasks about your everyday feelings \u2013 from joy and calm to sadness and frustration \u2013 offeringinsight into boththe pleasurable (hedonic) and meaningful (eudaimonic) sides of wellbeing. Ageing well isn\u2019t about beating a stopwatch or acing a memory test. It\u2019s about knowing yourself \u2013 your body, your mind and your values \u2013 and making small, meaningful changes that help you feel more you. So, go ahead, stand on one leg if you like. But don\u2019t forget to check in with your brain, body, emotions and your sense of purpose too.

Fresh from making audiences worldwide laugh as Rumi in the hit comedyColin from Accounts, Gay brings her infectious energy back to Adelaide to transform winter into a celebration of cabaret\u2019s unique magic from June 5-21. It\u2019s her second year in a row at the helm, and she\u2019s loving it. \u201cThis job has changed my life, and I\u2019m eternally grateful for it,\u201d Gay said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think anything could be more exciting than standing in a spotlight performing. Turns out, what I really love is standing in front of a whiteboard with a team of very sleep-deprived people, solving urgent problems to deliver an incredible evening to an audience.\u201d After two years steering the ship, she\u2019s confident she knows exactly how to wow the crowds. \u201cI know what these audiences want, because I have been these audiences,\u201d she says. \u201cCabaret, for me, in the purest or simplest terms, is stories into song,\u201d Gay says. \u201cIt is irreverent and mischievous, but it also has a fiery heart, a sense of the way that it would fight injustice. \u201cCabaret is a warm hug wrapped in a sequined blanket,\u201d she says, capturing the essence of why people are drawn to the art form even in the coldest winter months. It\u2019s also an art form that creates a unique relationship between the audience and performers. \u201cIt reminds you that we are all in this room together, making an experience together. A performer cannot exist without an audience, and an audience has no reason to exist without a performer. It\u2019s symbiotic, and it\u2019s sexy and fun and wild.\u201d This year\u2019s program showcases cabaret\u2019s versatility through unique events likeBetween the Covers, a singing book club that beautifully showcases cabaret\u2019s intimate storytelling, andLa Clique, where performers use their bodies to make cabaret in a way that\u2019s \u201cirreverent, mischievous, exposing but also incandescent\u201d. Gay\u2019s scene-stealing role inColin from Accounts\u2013 playing Rumi, the new girlfriend of Ashley\u2019s (Harriet Dyer) best friend Megan (Emma Harvie) \u2013 is the latest highlight in a stellar career spanning acting, singing, writing, and directing. \u201cThat [Colin from Accounts] dinner party scene \u2013 play a little loop at my funeral,\u201d she jokes. \u201cI think it might actually be the best work in my career.\u201d \u201cHonestly, [add] clips fromCalamity Jane, maybe somebody reading a bit ofCyrano, and then singing one cabaret song \u2013 that\u2019s my whole life!\u201d Despite being long-time friends with the show\u2019s creators, Dyer and husband Patrick Brammal, Virginia admits she went \u201cmega fangirl\u201d on set. \u201cI had to text Patrick afterwards to say \u2018Mate, I\u2019m sorry I went so insane on your set. It just happens to be that you\u2019ve created one of my favourite things in the entire world, and I\u2019m a mega fan \u2013 before I\u2019m an actor or your friend, it would appear!\u2019.\u201d Now embracing what she jokingly calls her \u201cvillain era\u201d, Gay says, \u201cI\u2019m with Rumi \u2013 no more good girls, no more nice guys. Bring on the complex characters and a bit of chaos!\u201d The 25th anniversary of Adelaide Cabaret Festival holds special meaning for Gay, who has enjoyed it as a fan, performer, and now artistic director. \u201cIf you\u2019d told me five years ago I\u2019d be artistic director, I\u2019d have said \u2018No way, me? In the same job as the likes of David Campbell, Kate Ceberano, Alan Cumming? Never\u2019,\u201d she says.

        "raw_text": "Matcha, with its vibrant green hue andcenturies-old tradition, is often celebrated as a health boosting superfood. But what exactly sets it apart from regular green tea, or even your morning coffee? Like green and black tea, matcha comes fromthecamellia sinensisplant. The difference lies in how it\u2019s grown and processed. While black tea is fermented and regular green tea is simply dried, matcha is shade-grown for several weeks before harvest. This unique methodalters the plant\u2019s chemistry byboosting certain compounds like chlorophyll and amino acids and giving matcha its distinct flavour and rich green colour. The leaves are then dried and finely ground into a powder \u2013 hence its name, which literally translates to \u201cpowdered tea\u201d in Japanese. Although widely associated with Japanese culture and Zen tea ceremonies, matchaoriginated in China. It was brought to Japan in the 12th Century by Buddhist monks, who used it to support meditation. Over time, it became a staple in Japanese tea culture, especially in formal tea ceremonies. From a health perspective, matcha offersmany of the same benefitsas green tea \u2013 thanks to itshigh content of polyphenols,including flavonoids, which are known antioxidants. However, because the leaves are consumed whole in powdered form, matcha may provide amore concentrated doseof these beneficial compounds. Matcha is touted for its widerange of potential health benefits: Anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory,anti-obesityandeven anti-cancer effects, as well as potentialimprovements in brain function, stress relief, heart health and blood sugar regulation. But there\u2019s a catch:Most of the evidencesupporting these claims comes from lab studies (on cells or animals), not robust clinical trials in humans. So while the early research is promising, it\u2019s far from conclusive. One thing we do know:Matcha contains caffeine\u2013 more than regular green tea, though typically less than coffee. Caffeine itself haswell-documented health benefitswhen consumed in moderation, including improved focus, mood and metabolism. It even reduces the risk of certain diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s. Buthigh doses can cause side-effectslike insomnia, anxiety and elevated blood pressure. The \u201cmore is better\u201d approach doesn\u2019t apply here, and the optimal dose of caffeineremains unclear. When comparing matcha to coffee, both offer similar anti-oxidant properties andcardiovascular benefits. However, coffee has beenstudied more extensively, with clearer guidelines:Three to four cups a dayappears to be a safe upper limit for most people. For matcha, the guidance is slightly more conservative, with sources suggestingone to three cups a day,probably due to the higher levels of polyphenols. Tannins and polyphenols in both tea and coffeecan interfere withiron absorption, especially from plant-based foods. Drinking large amounts regularly,particularly around mealtimes, may increase the risk of iron-deficiency anaemia. That\u2019s why it\u2019s recommended to enjoy these beverages at least two hours before or after meals, especially for people who follow a predominantly plant-based diet or are already prone to low iron levels. Another consideration: Both coffee and matcha are mildly acidic and cancause digestive discomfortor refluxin people with sensitive stomachs. That said, matcha may be a better choice for some. Unlike coffee, itcontains L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes relaxationand may counteractthe jittery effects of caffeine, making it a gentler alternative for people prone to anxiety. Both matcha and coffee have potential health benefits and the right choice depends on your personal needs and preferences. Coffee is better studied and may be ideal for those who tolerate caffeine well and enjoy several cups a day. Matcha, on the other hand, is a great option for those looking to consume less caffeine while still benefiting from antioxidants \u2013 and without the crash or jitters. Just remember to enjoy either in moderation, especially if you\u2019re managing iron levels or digestive issues.

The 76-year-old singer revealed he was suffering from normal pressure hydrocephalus, which is a condition that happens when cerebrospinal fluid builds up inside the skull, pressing on the brain. Joel described problems with his hearing, vision and balance, which were exacerbated by recent concert performances. His diagnosis comes months after he stumbled andfell during a concert at Mohegan Sun in Connecticut in February. More likely in people aged over 65, symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus resemble those of dementia. People may notice symptoms like trouble walking, poor balance, falling, forgetfulness and confusion, mood changes, depression and loss of bladder control. The condition is treatable with surgery to drain the fluid and can be reversible, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Joel said he was undergoing physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing while he recovers, according to a statement on social media. \u201cI\u2019m sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience, and thank you for understanding,\u201d Joel said. The tour, which had stops in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, had been due to start in February, but that was rescheduled to July due to an undisclosed medical condition. Joel, known for hits likePiano ManandUptown Girl, ended his record-breaking monthly Madison Square Garden residency \u2014 which had begun in 2014 \u2014 last year. -with AAP",

        "raw_text": "Grieving the death of a parent is often considered a natural part of life. But there are added layers of complexity when you had a difficult or estranged relationship. This week former tennis star Jelena Dokic confirmed the death of her father and former coach Damir, whose verbal, physical and emotional abuse sherevealed in 2009and further detailed in her2017 autobiography. They had been estranged for a decade. In asocial media poston Thursday, Dokic wrote about her \u201cconflicting and complex emotions and feelings\u201d around his death: \u2018\u2018No matter how how hard, difficult and in the last 10 years even non existent [sic] our relationship and communication was, it is never easy losing a parent [\u2026] The loss of an estranged parent comes with a difficult and complicated grief.\u2019\u2019 Dokic\u2019s news is a reminder that, when a parent dies, not all of us get to grieve a stable, warm and comforting relationship. As in her case, a strained relationship might even be marked by maltreatment or abuse. Relinquishing contact can sometimes be the best, albeit difficult, choice. When the parent dies, the loss can feel surprisingly complex. We may be grieving both the literal death of the parent and the figurative death, of what should have been \u2013 what we wished for and desired. Grief is nota single emotion. Usually, it involves a combination of many. Common feelings can include sadness, guilt, anger and even relief. In sharing her social media post, Dokic has said among conflicting emotions she\u2019s chosen to \u201cfocus on a good memory\u201d. Grief can reach beyond feelings. It candisrupt eating and sleepinghabits andimpairmemory and concentration. Deaths can also affect relationships. For example, when grieving, someone might receive a lot of social support from family, friends and colleagues. But for others, the support they\u2019d like might not be forthcoming. The lack of support is yet another loss and is linked toworse physical and mental health. Family members may also react in different ways. It might be jarring or alienating if your sibling responds differently, for example by sharing fond memories of a parent you found harsh and distant. A death can also affect your financial standing. A grieving person may be burdened with outstanding bills and funeral payments. Or the impact can be positive, via windfalls from insurance and inheritance. With grief, it\u2019s OK to feel how you feel. You might think you\u2019re grieving the \u201cwrong\u201d way, but it can be helpful to remember there are no strict rules about how to grieve \u201cright\u201d. Be gentle on yourself. And give other family members, who may have had a different relationship with the parent and therefore grieve differently, the same courtesy. It\u2019s also OK to feel conflicted about going to the funeral. In this case, take the time to think through the pros and cons of attending. It might be helpful in processing your grief and in receiving support. Or you might feel that attending would be too difficult or emotionally unsafe for you. If you choose to attend, it can help to go with someone who can support you through it. In an estranged relationship, the adult child might not even find out about the death of the parent for many weeks or months afterwards. This means there is no option of attending the funeral or other mourning rituals. Consider makingyour own ritualsto help process the loss and grief. It can be really confusing to feel sad about the death of a parent with whom we had a difficult, strained or violent relationship. Identifying where these conflicting thoughts and feelings come from can help. You might need toacknowledge and grievethe loss of your parent, the loss of the parent-child relationship you deserved, and even the loss of hoped-for apologies and reconnections. In many cases, it is a combination of these losses that can make the grief more challenging. It may also be difficult to get the social support you need from family, friends and colleagues. These potential helpers might be unaware of the difficulties you experienced in the relationship, or incorrectly believe troubled relationships are easier to grieve. It can feel like a taboo to speak ill of the dead, but it might be helpful to be clear about the relationship and your needs so that people can support you better. In fact, grieving the death of people with whom we have challenging, conflicting or even abusive relationships can lead tomore griefthan the death of those with whom we shared a warm, loving and more straightforward relationship. If the loss is particularly difficult and your grief doesn\u2019t change and subside over time, seek support from your general practitioner. They might be able to recommend a psychologist or counsellor with expertise in grief. Alternatively, you can find certified bereavement practitioners who have specialised training in grief supportonlineor seek telephone support from Griefline on 1300 845 745.

The audio book, the English version of which runs to seven hours, has been narrated with artificial intelligence. \u201cI am honoured to bring youMelania \u2013 The AI Audiobook\u2013 narrated entirely using artificial intelligence in my own voice,\u201d Trump wrote in a post on X, along with a futuristic video. \u201cLet the future of publishing begin.\u201d The book was created by Eleven Labs \u201cunder Mrs Trump\u2019s direction and supervision\u201d. Itcan be bought from her website for $US25 ($A39). \u201cMy story. My perspective. The truth,\u201d the narrator says in a promotional clip posted by Trump to social media. ElevenLabs CEO Mati Staniszewski said it was a \u201cfirst-of-its-kind audiobook project\u201d, and the company looked \u201cforward to helping bring this book to the public in many other languages\u201d in Trump\u2019s \u201cown voice\u201d. The written version of the 55-year-old\u2019s memoir was published back in October last year, a day before the US election that returned her husband Donald to the White House for a second presidential term. It tells the story of her youth in Slovenia and her journey into the world of high fashion, as well as her meeting with and marriage to Trump. Melania also shared \u201cstories and images never before shared with the public\u201d from her early years, home life and time in the White House as first lady. \u201cEach story shaped me into who I am today,\u201d she told Fox News at the time. \u201cAlthough daunting at times, the process has been incredibly rewarding, reminding me of my strength, and the beauty of sharing my truth.\u201d The book\u00a0received a lukewarm reception at the time.The New York Timesdescribed it asa \u201cbrazen whitewash of a presidency\u2026 slim and full of obfuscations\u201d. \u201cMelania Trump\u2019s new memoir offers a few new glimpses into a life she has carefully walled off from the public, but readers hoping to understand one of the most mysterious first ladies in modern history will not make it past the gilded front gate,\u201d wrote White House correspondent, Katie Rogers. \u201cHer grievances \u2013 with the news media, with \u2018the opposition\u2019 and with aides she believes failed her and her husband \u2013 sound a lot like her husband\u2019s, only dressed up in couture.\u201d \u201cVery proud\u201d husband Donald, on the other hand, was full of praise. \u201cHer book is out Nationally, and for sale EVERYWHERE. It is really great! She was a fantastic First Lady, and shares that experience, and much more. She\u2019s also a really good writer \u2026 perfect for Christmas,\u201d he wrote on social media. Melania has kept a low profile in Washington DC since Trump returned to the presidency in January. Earlier this week, she appeared with him at the White House to sign the \u201cTake It Down Act\u201d \u2013 a law that seeks to crack down on the online distribution of nonconsensual intimate imagery such as revenge porn. During the signing ceremony in the White House rose garden, Melania warned of the possible negative effects of AI. \u201cThe widespread presence of abusive behaviour in the digital domain affects the daily lives of our children, families, and communities,\u201d she said. She said dealing with the issue was essential in fostering \u201ca safe and supportive environment for our young people\u201d. \u201cAI and social media are the digital candy for the next generation, sweet, addictive and engineered to have an impact on the cognitive development of our children,\u201d she said. \u201cBut unlike sugar, these new technologies can be weaponised, shape beliefs and, sadly, affect emotions and even be deadly.\u201d",

        "raw_text": "Bono was jubilant and emotional at the Cannes premiere of his highly personal documentaryBono: Stories of Surrender, holding his wife Alison Hewson\u2019s hand and thanking his four children and his U2 bandmates and manager Paul McGuinness, for a life well lived. \u201cYou wrote this story,\u201d he said. Naming daughters Jordan and Eve and sons Jordan and Elijah, he noted: \u201cYou wrote the story and you continue to write your own story. I\u2019m very proud of you. The Edge (Dave Evans) wrote this story, Adam (Clayton, bassist) and Larry (Mullen Jr, drums) wrote this story. McGuinness wrote this story. We\u2019re still writing it \u2013 it\u2019s still a work in progress.\u201d Born Paul Hewson in 1960 in Dublin, Bono had initially written a 2022 memoir,Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story. To mark its publication the U2 frontman devised a one-man show described as \u201can evening of words, music and some mischief\u201d and embarked on a tour of intimate gigs throughout the US and Europe. In 2023 he teamed up with Australian director Andrew Dominik to recreate a filmed version of the show at New York\u2019s historic Beacon Theatre. Apart from a dynamic closing moment, Dominik shotStories of Surrenderin black-and-white as he did with 2016\u2019sOne More Time With Feeling,focusing on Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds. (Dominik also collaborated with Cave on 2022\u2019sThis Much I Know to be True,which was largely shot in black-and-white and drew on the death of Cave\u2019s son Arthur.)  Bono saysStories of Surrender, which he co-wrote with Bill Flanagan, is an attempt to cast off the mask of fame and reveal his true self. We see the singer, dressed in a black jacket, black pants and orange-tinted glasses, perform songs and tell of his life, recalling his mother Iris\u2019s death from a brain aneurysm when he was 14 and his fractured relationship with his hard-to-please opera-loving father, Brendan, a wannabe singer. Bono\u2019s saving grace was meeting Alison, whom he\u2019d known since they were 12. They got together three years later.\u201cShe was a 15-year-old girl who had faith in me, she encouraged my dreams,\u201d he says. Incredibly, he notes how he joined up with guitarist Dave Evans (Edge), bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr to form U2 in the same week. The band would achieve huge success, selling 170 million albums and winning a record-breaking 22 Grammys. In 1983 U2 had a huge hit with the politically chargedSunday Bloody Sunday,focusing on the violence in Northern Ireland. Two years later they sang at Live Aid, which raised US$250 million to feed starving refugees in Africa. \u201cWhere you live should not decide whether you live,\u201d he says in the show. \u201cLives matter, justice matters.\u201d While he admits to being overpaid and overfed \u2013\u201dhypocrites get a bad rap\u201d, he muses \u2013 he recalls the difficulties in his life. In 2016 a congenital heart condition almost killed him, but then the film becomes about his father. He left home at an early age to escape him. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I forgive my father. Surrender does not come easy,\u201d he says. But then Bono wonders if their fractured relationship was his fault. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could be a father because I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d been much of a son.\u201d In any case he says, \u201cI craved my father\u2019s attention and he didn\u2019t hear me, so I sang louder and louder.\u201d Bono now recognises that his father was grieving and was unable to support him through his mother\u2019s death. His father would not even mention her death in their Dublin home. He recalls his brother Norman giving him a guitar. \u201cI was singing Ramones\u2019 songs in the living room around my 18thbirthday and all my Da (father) wanted to talk to me about was getting a job. He didn\u2019t want to know about rock and roll.\u201d Later in life he would meet his father on Sundays in a Dublin pub. By this time Bono was famous and while he could recognise his father\u2019s pride\u00a0 \u2013 \u201cI heard your songPrideon the radio the other day and I might have felt some\u201d, he recalls his father saying \u2013he notes how he was only able to see him as a friend after his death from cancer in 2001. Still, he has some fond memories like when his father Brendan, an anti-royalist, met Princess Diana and was star struck.\u201cEight centuries of oppression melted away in eight seconds!\u201d Bono chortles. Bono\u2019s activism is also dealt with in the film and he later told one interviewer: \u201cYou know, even the change, the world stuff, comes back to me trying to impress my father. \u201cNow here I am with stories of surrender. The word surrender sounds preposterous in a moment when it seems like the planet is determined to set fire to itself. We\u2019re closer to a world war than at any time in my life. We have to evolve past violence. So that\u2019s my position, and I held it when I was 23 and was laughed and mocked. That\u2019s okay. John Lennon was prepared to look ridiculous for peace.\u201d At the Cannes premiere, Bono commended Plan B for producing the documentary. \u201cI want to thank Brad Pitt for not showing up, because he would steal the show,\u201d he said with a chuckle. He also addressed the late Steve Jobs, the Apple founder whose company helped finance the film. \u201cI visited Steve Jobs down the coast not so long ago and he was a man who had grown such a gigantic company. You treated me so tenderly. Imagine (Apple) paying for us to go to Italy to shoot that fantasy scene about my father.\u201d Bono also thanked Sean Penn, who was in the audience and had brought Ukrainian soldiers to the ceremony. \u201cIf I was in the trenches, like real trenches, as opposed to ones on a movie set, I\u2019d want to be with Sean Penn in those trenches,\u201d Bono said. He also thanked the musicians on stage, cellist Kate Ellis and harpist Gemma Doherty, who breathe fresh life into U2 hits includingSunday Bloody Sunday, Beautiful DayandPride (In the Name of Love). Lastly, Bono thanked director Andrew Dominik: \u201cOh my, he\u2019s not here, he\u2019s working,\u201d Bono said, attempting an Australian accent. \u201cAndrew, I love your vision, and I can\u2019t believe you got those performances out of me and thank you for that.\u201d Bono: Stories of Surrenderstreams on Apple TV+ from May 30.",

So all I can do is turn up,\u201d he told theGuardian. In 2020, Osbourne revealed he had been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease and he paused touring in 2023 after extensive spinal surgery. \u201cYou wake up the next morning and find that something else has gone wrong. You begin to think this is never going to end,\u201d he said.

        "raw_text": "Australia has a multitude of comeback stories \u2013 our America\u2019s Cup victory, Steven Bradbury\u2019s miracle on ice, even John Howard\u2019s political resurrection. Jimmy Barnes launched a successful solo career after leaving Cold Chisel and overcame addiction and health struggles (mostly he is included here so I can point you to anold columnabout him). I\u2019d argue we\u2019re about to see another unexpected comeback \u2013 online piracy. Back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the music industry was in full-blown panic mode. The culprits? Two names that still trigger nostalgia for elder millennials: Napster and Limewire. Music was purchased on CDs at the time, either as full albums or as singles. An album in 2000 probably set you back over $20. Downloading a music track as an MP3 file, albeit very illegally, via Napster was a quick and cheap (free) way to access new music. Blank CDs cost about a dollar in bulk. Suddenly you could build your own music library \u2014 cheaper and better than what the industry offered. If you listened to your music collection on the family PC, no costs other than the monthly internet bill were there to hold you back. Eventually, the music industry caught on. The iTunes Music Store launched in Australia in October 2005. A single song was priced at $1.69. Most albums were priced at $16.99. Not an amazing price, considering how cheap pirated music was, but convenient for the newly emerged iPod crowd. The real turning point didn\u2019t come until 2012 when Spotify launched in Australia (four years after its US and European debut) and changed everything. Music wasn\u2019t just cheaper, it was bundled into a monthly subscription. No need to plan which music to download, just stream any song you are interested in instantly. Why steal music when, for an affordable $11.99 per month, you have a superior user experience? A plethora of platforms copied the Spotify model. Today you can listen to (almost) any song you want on all platforms. Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, or Amazon Music Unlimited all offer essentially the same music experience. Music piracy largely died off. The quality and ease of the music subscription model is simply better than the cumbersome process of online piracy.  Recorded music revenues in the US fell from their heights of 1999 until 2014. By 2021 revenues surpassed 1999 levels. Granted, these numbers aren\u2019t adjusted for inflation, and music still isn\u2019t nearly as big a business as it was in 1999. Recorded music is now almost exclusively an online business. Profit margins are higher than they were in the past since the supply chain is much cheaper to handle for digital goods. All in all, the music industry reacted to online piracy and managed to live another day. So, online piracy is dead then and will never rise again? Not so fast, cowboy! Music isn\u2019t the only product that digital pirates share online. Movies, TV shows, video games and live sports are also merrily pirated. When Netflix launched in 2015 in Australia for $9.99 per month, it was a game-changer. We could legally access heaps of content without dodgy torrents and sites full of pornographic or gambling popups, or low-quality movie bootlegs. Want to add subtitles or switch audio language? No problem on Netflix. Piracy didn\u2019t disappear, but it no longer felt worth the hassle. For a brief moment, streaming movies and shows seemed to go the way of music streaming: a better user experience makes the use of pirated content obsolete. But that\u2019s not what happened. For movies and TV shows, the market also fragmented. Disney+, Paramount+, Amazon Prime, Stan, and countless others entered the scene. Unlike music platforms, where content heavily overlaps, each video service keeps its catalogue locked away. Video streaming once was a convenient solution but is now an annoying digital scavenger hunt without a decent treasure map. In arecent columnI suggested you watchThe Fisher King(1991). Where do you find the movie? No idea. You try streaming it right now and time yourself. How long until you have the movie up and running? It\u2019s cumbersome. And nothing is permanent. Titles vanish from libraries without warning. Even digital purchases can be deleted or restricted. Amazon\u2019s done exactly that. The only reliable way to keep a show? Download it illegally. Not exactly an anti-piracy strategy. To control costs and rights, streaming services became studios. Netflix now spends billions producing its own content. That content will not be available on other platforms. How many streaming services does your household subscribe to? It\u2019s five in mine at the moment (BeinSport, Stan, YouTube Plus, Amazon Prime, Disney+) but this will be cut down in a rage quit once I finish writing this column. We\u2019ve gone from bingeing everything on one platform to hoping our preferred service has something worth watching. Swapping subscriptions sounds good in theory, but in practice it\u2019s a chore. The psychology is clear, we don\u2019t cancel subscriptions the second we don\u2019t need them, and service providers use this behaviour against us. To make the user experience worse, platforms like Netflix that once encouraged password sharing now crack down on it. Ad-free tiers quietly include ads. Maybe you are on an overseas trip and want to stream something? Good luck. Your library is limited or might not work at all in the case of sports (Stan and BeinSport). Over the last few years, services asked for more money while offering less certainty. In the early days of Netflix, users spoke highly of the platform. It\u2019s rare to find people praising a platform these days. Disney+ for example only has a very limited number of movies available in German \u2013 that would be my particular use case for the platform \u2013 easy language learning for the kids. Heaps of migrant families in Australia complain about the lack of content in their mother tongue even though its available. Unsurprisingly, frustrated viewers have been returning to piracy\u2014not because they want to steal, but because that\u2019s the only option. Even Netflix, in its own reports, acknowledges piracy is back. Today\u2019s pirate sites look and feel like legitimate platforms \u2013 except they\u2019re free and have broader libraries. Video games are harder to pirate than ever since more and more titles are multiplayer games that run on official servers. Also, more and more games are consumed on smartphones and illegal software can\u2019t conveniently be installed via the Apple and Android app stores. For sports, the need to use illegal services is even bigger because the user experience is outrageously bad especially for fans following international or niche competitions. I for example want to watch my favourite German football team, Bayern Munich, play. The Bundesliga, the German league, is shown on BeinSport ($14.99/month). The UEFA Champions League is shown on STAN. You can\u2019t just purchase access to STAN Sport which is $15/month,\u00a0 you have to purchase a STAN Standard ($17) or STAN Premium ($22) package too. Bayern Munich also play in the FIFA Club World Cup in June \u2013 that\u2019s shown on yet another platform (Optus Sport $24.99). Football fans follow a club, not a competition. A meaningful bundle would be all games across all competitions from your club. But by splitting streaming rights to different platforms, three rather than one platform can make profits from sporting fans. Watching sports, especially international sports, is stupendously expensive and cumbersome if you are a law-abiding customer. So, what\u2019s ahead? Video streaming services will not change their business model as long as it\u2019s profitable. In Australia they still have a rich consumer base that is able to pay high prices for ever worsening user experiences. The legal services will continue the status quo. I would expect that in times of a prolonged cost-of-living crisis more Australian households will look to cut the high subscription fees and look at illegal alternatives. Turning to illegal sites will bring new cybersecurity risks \u2013 because, nostalgia aside, pirate sites still make money somehow, often through shady means.

The singer took to Instagram with a lengthy post explaining how fans asking for selfies can cause him discomfort and panic, and shared examples from a recent flight in the US. \u201cI\u2019ve had three interactions so far with fellow passengers. One of them handed me a lovely note \u2013 kind words about my documentary \u2013 and then asked for a photo,\u201d Williams said. He said he wrote a note back explaining how he\u2019d had little sleep, wrangled four children through the airport, and that his anxiety would spike if they came and took a photo because the whole cabin would then begin wondering who he was. A steward then asked for a selfie on behalf of another passenger, before a third passenger then just walked up and asked outright for a selfie to which he agreed, Williams said. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of unspoken law: as a celebrity, you should be accessible 24/7. Greet all strangers like you\u2019re the mayor of the best town anyone\u2019s ever visited.

US District Judge Monica Almadani in Los Angeles in a ruling said the writers of Vince Vance and the Valiants\u2019All I Want for Christmas Is Youfailed to show their song was objectively similar enough to Carey\u2019s to support their copyright infringement case. Lawyers for the songwriters, lawyers for Carey and spokespeople for her label, Sony Music, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the decision on Thursday (local time). Vince Vance and the Valiants\u2019All I Want for Christmas Is Youwas released in 1989 and reached the Billboard country charts during holiday seasons in the 1990s. Carey\u2019s song appeared on her 1994 albumMerry Christmasand has become a popular standard, topping theBillboardHot 100 chart every holiday season since 2019.All I Want For Christmas Is Youis reported to have earned more than $US60 million ($A95 million) since it was first released.

Almadani also ordered the songwriters to pay part of Carey\u2019s lawyers\u2019 fees, finding some of their filings contained a \u201clitany of irrelevant and unsupported factual assertions.\u201d -AAP",

Some 24 years later, the reality is different \u2014 and it\u2019s not just the lack of videotape grain. The dancers, costume changes and dramatic entrances are all there, but the elaborate sets of two decades ago have been replaced by modern stage blocks and electronic visuals. Minogue enters the stage on a large swing, before starting the set in a mock diamond cage created by blue laser lighting. Opening with the lead single of her latest album and tour namesake, 2024\u2019sTension II, it sets us up for a night of the EDM-inspired sounds she has embraced with her latest releases. Eight dancers accompany Minogue with rigid and robotic movements, while metallic costuming and styling create a futuristic atmosphere. The past is never far from mind, however, as she dips into her older repertoire with brief versionsIn Your EyesandGet Outta My Way. The dancers take centre stage when Minogue exits the stage to swap a silver sequined dress for a red utility vest and baggy pants \u2014 the first of five costume changes. This ensemble also change colour and shape throughout the night, from sheer long sleeve tops and baggy pants with boater hats to colourful inflatable shapes that look like they could be characters in a children\u2019s television show. Throughout the set, Minogue strikes a careful balance between the new material and fans that have given her career a second \u2014 or perhaps fourth or fifth \u2014 wind, and the older hits that are baked into pop culture and childhood memories. It\u2019s clear that Minogue still holds a genuine love for these songs too \u2014 although it\u2019s hard to hold a candle to the passion of her fans. At one point, Minogue brings an overwhelmed fan on stage with her to have a hug and a private moment. Minogue makes her way to a small stage towards the back of the arena for some stripped back moments, offering fans roses and indulging requests from the audience with acapella snippets ofI Should Be So LuckyandPlease Stay.These moments give fans a moment to appreciate her voice free of the arena-filling electronic sounds that dominate the rest of the set. The volume returns when Minogue heads back to the mainstage for her the heavy bass drops and strobe lights of her club era, topped off with her Grammy-winning comeback hitPadam Padamwhich is rightfully given its moment in the spotlight. Padam Padammight have introduced her to new audiences, a simple \u201cLa la la\u201d is all fans need to be thrown back to 2001\u2019s chart-toppingCan\u2019t Get You Out of My Head.

Sharon Osbourne said the band\u2019s long-awaited reunion was emotional for her husband, who can no longer walk due to the worsening of his Parkinson\u2019s disease. \u201cHe\u2019s very happy to be coming back and very emotional about this,\u201d Osbourne told British media on Thursday (local time). \u201cParkinson\u2019s is a progressive disease. It\u2019s not something you can stabilise. It affects different parts of the body and it\u2019s affected his legs. \u201cBut his voice is as good as it\u2019s ever been.\u201d It follows the announcement this week that76-year-old Ozzy will join the other original members of heavy metal band Black Sabbathfor the first time in 20 years to play a one-off concert in Birmingham. Billed as \u201cthe greatest heavy metal show ever\u201d, the July 5 show at the band\u2019s birthplace will also feature guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward \u2013 the group that pioneered heavy metal music in the early 1970s with hits such asWar Pigs, ParanoidandIron Man. Black Sabbath has sold more than 75 million records since forming in 1968. Their last gig together was in\u00a02005, with the band playing in partial reunions since but never in their original line-up. Ozzy, the group\u2019s charismatic frontman, left Black Sabbath in 1979 due to drug and alcohol problems. He had a highly successful solo career \u2013 including 13 solo albums \u2013 before revealing in 2020 that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s. The star, who will move back to Britain in March, also spoke about his condition on an American radio show this week. \u201cI have made it to 2025. I can\u2019t walk, but you know what I was thinking over the holidays? For all my complaining, I\u2019m still alive,\u201d he said. \u201cI may be moaning that I can\u2019t walk but I look down the road and there\u2019s people that didn\u2019t do half as much as me and didn\u2019t make it.\u201d The July 5 concert is being billed as Black Sabbath\u2019s final show. It will top a line-up that also includes Metallica, Slayer, Pantera, Alice in Chains, Lamb Of God and Anthrax. The show\u2019s music director, Rage Against The Machine\u2019s Tom Morello, said: \u201cThis will be the greatest heavy metal show ever.\u201d However, he has refused to say if the night will feature any new music. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We haven\u2019t really talked about that. In fact, we haven\u2019t seen each other,\u201d Morello said. \u201cWe certainly haven\u2019t seen all of us together for a long time. I mean, I stay in touch with Oz and occasionally Geezer, but never Bill. So I don\u2019t even know what Bill does these days.\u201d Profits from the show, called Back to the Beginning, will be donated to charities including Cure Parkinson\u2019s.

        "raw_text": "Keith Urban first hit the streets of Tamworth as a nine-year-old busking in Peel Street. He\u2019d been building up to it since his dad noticed the kid had rhythm, so bought him a toy ukulele when he was four. Later, in 1979 in Tamworth, Keith saw Slim Dusty honoured on the Australian Country Music Hall of Fame\u2019s Roll of Renown. A million road miles and thousands of gigs later, Keith returned to Tamworth recently to receive the same award. The full circle moment wasn\u2019t wasted on him. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Urban tells me a few days later in Sydney. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s surreal to be on that rock [that serves as the honour board]. I think Slim was only the third or fourth guy to get a plaque on the rock, and there are over 50 people on that thing now. \u201cI remember when I was 10, or 11, and I stood in this long line of people waiting to get Slim\u2019s autograph. I\u2019d just bought the sheet music toLights on the Hilland worked my way up the line. I said, \u2018Hello, I\u2019m Keith, and he signed it for me\u2019. Twelve years later, I got to record that song with him as a duet, and go on tour with him.\u201d While Tamworth is crucial to Urban\u2019s story, so is Brisbane. It\u2019s one of the cities on his Australian tour in August. He\u2019ll kick that off in Newcastle on August 13 before playing Brisbane, Wollongong, Sydney and Melbourne before winding up with a show in Adelaide on August 28. Brisbane is the city where Urban learnt his craft and paid his bills playing in cover bands while trying to build a fan base for his original music. A lucky few hundred fans were given a taste of that apprenticeship when Urban recently played a club show at Lefty\u2019s Music Hall in Brisbane to promote his widely acclaimed new album, High. More used to playing arenas these days, a club show that size was a time warp. So much so that by the time the concert had hit the 2\u00bd-hour mark, the audience had reverted to \u201980s pub mode and were calling out for covers by The Angels and Cold Chisel. Urban obliged. \u201cAussie crowds are no BS,\u201d Urban says. \u201cIf you sucked back then, they\u2019d let you know. But equally, if they liked you, you\u2019d know that too. In hindsight, it was a great way to grow up, because it was a brutally honest environment. There was no filter. \u201cI remember back then thinking, Oh God, if I just had one song that they knew the words to, it would be the most amazing feeling. But it was like, Oh well, let\u2019s doApril Sun in Cubaagain. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you the good part about that \u2013 you learn a lot playing those covers in pubs. You\u2019re always asking yourself, why does this song work? Why does this one really work? Which part of that song just kills it? And you start to sense these patterns in writing, melodic structure and other various things. \u201cI think The Beatles had that with all the years playing in Hamburg. It\u2019s the same thing. It really gives you good bones as a musician.\u201d Urban worked on his craft and became so popular after moving to Nashville that his name started popping up on records made by everyone from the Dixie Chicks to Garth Brooks. After a metaphorical long march, the great leap forward finally happened. An international star now, Urban hit the big time when he cracked the American charts. The rest of the world complied. Urban\u2019s own albums started to soar and a string of No.1 and top five records followed the release of theGolden Roadalbum in 2002. With more hit singles than you can poke a stick at, Urban has collaborated with everyone from Amy Shark to Taylor Swift. As for his guitar playing, scroll through YouTube and you\u2019ll find him jamming alongside everyone from Peter Frampton to The Rolling Stones. Right now, he\u2019s rehearsing a new band and is gearing up to tourHighacross Australia in August, dubbed High and Alive. \u201cI like the dark humour of the title in relation to my past,\u201d he says ofHigh. \u201cI know it\u2019s jarring for some people to even think of the word humour when it comes to addiction, but I like people doing whatever they want to do at my concerts. I\u2019ve been sober for a long time. Just get in the zone and let\u2019s have a great time.\u201d More informationhere This article first appeared inInReview. Read the originalhere",

Chappell Roan nudged aside Sabrina Carpenter to win the Grammy for best new artist, capping a remarkably explosive rise to fame for an artist dropped by her last record label.

        "raw_text": "There are two verses toAdvance Australia Fair, but do you know the second? Probably not. It\u2019s in our citizenship booklet,Our Common Bond, suggesting Aussies know it and new citizens could be questioned on it in their citizenship test. Yetofficial protocolmakes singing it optional. And who\u2019ll choose to sing both verses when thousands of sporting fans just want the game to start? There are living generations who never properly learntAdvance Australia Fair. Before 1984,most school studentssangGod Save the Queen. Schools today teach verse one, but whether we learn verse two is haphazard. If school students sing along to a pre-recorded accompaniment with two verses, we\u2019ll learn verse two. If we sing along with a squeaking school beginner band, one verse is probably all we\u2019ll endure. I suspect if we knew the second verse our common bond would be arguing about it. Australiansacted passionatelywhen debating one word in verse one, yet verse two barely raises an eyebrow. It\u2019s the controversy we need to have (after we\u2019ve googled the lyrics). The problem with verse two comes from its origins. It wasn\u2019t in Peter Dodds McCormick\u2019s original 1878 composition. Hissecond versechampioned gallant Cook sailing with British courage to raise old England\u2019s flag, proving \u201cBritannia rules the waves\u201d. His third and fourth verses weren\u2019t any more appropriate. So, beforeAdvance Australia Fairbecame our anthem in 1984, the National Australia Day Council made shrewd edits. Instead of using verse two from McCormick\u2019s original version, they turned toanother version ofAdvance Australia Fairwritten for federation in 1901. The federation version introduced a new commemorative verse, the only other verse the council kept: Beneath our radiant Southern Cross we\u2019ll toil with hearts and handsTo make our youthful Commonwealth renowned of all the landsFor loyal sons beyond the seas we\u2019ve boundless plains to shareWith courage let us all combine to Advance Australia Fair. Next, the council fixed the gendered language in the federation verse. \u201cLoyal sons\u201d became \u201cthose who\u2019ve come\u201d. They deleted \u201cyouthful\u201d with an uncanny premonition that age would become sensitive. (For verse one, Australians resolved the debate ingeniously in 2021by replacing\u201cyoung and free\u201d with \u201cone and free\u201d.) But that\u2019s all the council changed in verse two. They endorsed the rest. The federation verse, understandably, celebrated the politics of 1901. The lyrics begin mildly but repetitively, \u201cBeneath our radiant Southern Cross we\u2019ll toil with hearts and hands\u201d. I\u2019m not sure why we\u2019re toiling in both verses. Perhaps Aussies have an exceptional work ethic. In the next line, the word \u201ccommonwealth\u201d was included to mark federation. The forming of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901 marked a transition from six British colonies (New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland) into one nation. On one hand, it celebrates unity and cooperation between colonies. But by singing the intended meaning of the verse, that the nation began when the colonies united, we disrespect the knowledge Australia already was many nations of First Peoples. In 1901, Australia\u2019s idea of sharing land was specific. We recruited enthusiastically for more British immigration, yet rejected migrants who weren\u2019t white. The Immigration Restriction Act 1901, one of our parliament\u2019s first laws, allowed immigration officers to set near impossible dictation tests in any European language. In effect, this meant anyone could be excluded from immigrating by what would be known as the White Australia Policy. Australia\u2019s 21st century approach to sharing with foreigners also draws media attention. The breach of human rights atdetention centresand the limiting ofinternational student visasto stem migration suggest we have \u201cbounds\u201d after all. If the federation verse is theoretically testable for new citizens, then we should check if the values of 1901 and 2025 still match. Without checking, Australia is stagnating, not advancing. The way forward is in the last line of verse two: \u201cWith courage let us all combine to Advance Australia Fair\u201d. In 1901, that was a plea for spirit and cooperation between colonies when forming a national parliament. Yet, there\u2019s a timeless truth in those words. By debating our anthem courageously, we can be united by challenge, enriched by diversity and ingenious at rewriting lyrics.

        "raw_text": "I can remember the mixed feelings I experienced as a teenager in 1997, buyingLife Thru A Lens\u2013 my firstRobbie Williamsalbum \u2013 cautious it was too poppy to sit with my humble-but-growing CD collection of artists that would later be known asBritpop. Yet, the album\u2019s inherent cheekiness combined with moments of vulnerability made it something I was comfortable to include as part of the soundtrack to my adolescent life. I was reminded of these feelings watchingBetter Man, directorMichael Gracey\u2019snew biopic musical that charts the story of the Williams\u2019 journey to superstardom, along with his self-consciousness regarding where he fits as an artist and person. The singer-songwriter is present throughout the film, albeit off-screen in the form of the narrator, guiding us through his history: growing up in Stoke-on-Trent, the son of divorced parents, his joining and dismissal from boy band Take That, the reckless partying, his brief relationship with Nicole Appleton, and his own solo career. There is often a brutal honesty in these events, where no one (including Williams) comes off particularly well. Insecurity, the search for self-authenticity and the desire for acceptance are the three elements that fuel the film. \u201cRobbie became a character, something I could hide behind,\u201d says Williams the narrator, offering some rationale for the CGI monkey used to portray the artist. In case you\u2019ve missed the publicity, Williams is \u201cplayed\u201d by actor Jonno Davies, but in a computerised twist, special visual effects present the performer as a CGI walking-talking-singing-dancing simian. Williams as chimpanzee is a stylisation choice which seemingly goes unnoticed by other human characters inBetter Man. The film is not attempting a sci-fi tone like 2017\u2019sWar for the Planet of the Apes, but to my surprise makes much better use of CGI precisely for that reason. These visual effects serve to remind the viewer of the pure artifice of the music industry and how fabricated identity \u2013 particularly that of performers who have no direct control over it \u2013 can take its toll. According to Hollywood industry magazineVariety,William\u2019s descriptionof himself as a performing monkey is what inspired Gracey\u2019s aesthetic choice. However, I wonder if there is also some nod to the2008 media reportsof Williams walking around Los Angeles disguised in a gorilla suit after a three-month period of isolation. Like the suit, or even Damon Albarn\u2019s virtual band,Gorillaz, the chimpanzee avatar provides a liminal role that keeps the performer present and absent at the same time. This is a theme that the film attempts to deal with in both content and form, emphasised through the performer\u2019s off-screen narration. This fragmented, entertainment-led construction of identity is also a continuation of themes explored in Hugh Jackman\u2019sThe Greatest Showman, also directed by Gracey. Better Man, unlike Gracey\u2019s earlier film however, strives (in the script at least) for grittier realism, with expletive language from the beginning. This is not a film for young fans, who might anyway only be tangentially aware of Williams through a different animal in Robin Shaw\u2019s adaptation ofThe Tiger Who Came to Tea, in which the singer provided the central song. What I found particularly engaging about the film is the ordinariness and honesty of Williams. He doesn\u2019t claim to be overly talented, but is rather someone who owes his initial fame to his cheeky-chappy persona, often presented as a coping mechanism for dealing with rejection. The film indicates how his desire for attention is presented as the result of the singer\u2019s sometime-absent father, Pete Conway (Steve Pemberton), a struggling performer who lives for the stage but never quite made it. The young simian is left to contemplate his father\u2019s mantra \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re either a somebody or a nobody\u201d \u2013 which cues some tender moments with his grandmother Betty (Alison Steadman), presented as one of the most positive relationships in his early life. Imagery of Williams and Betty at home together on the sofa, embraced in the television glow of comedy showThe Two Ronniesgives the film a sense of nostalgia. But the unhealthy and unrealistic reverence that goes with global stardom is also presented as a damaging experience that precedes the star\u2019s drug addiction and isolation. These themes are something of a far cry from your average musical film. Characters spontaneously break into song (Take That or Robbie Williams tracks) in addition to scenes that focus on rehearsals and show performances, sharply reminding us of the constructed reality of pop-star life. The film\u2019s strength lies in portraying the veneer of stratospheric success that masks the human insecurity just below the surface, encapsulated by the CGI monkey modelled on the features of both Williams and actor Jonno Davies. For me, this was one of the best reasons to see it, but if you need more, there is a huge playlist of familiar tracks, including a spectacular high-octane montage ofRock DJ. Go seeBetter Manand let it entertain you. Daniel O\u2019Brien, Lecturer, Department of Literature Film and Theatre Studies,University of Essex.",

Stewart will turn 80 before his festival appearance, making him a a member of a select and small group of 80-plus artists. Paul McCartney\u00a0was 80\u00a0when he performed at the festival in 2022, while the late Burt Bacharachwas 87 when he took the stage in 2015. Glastonbury festival organiser Emily Eavis said in a post on Instagram: \u201cBringing Sir Rod Stewart back for the Sunday afternoon slot on the Pyramid stage is everything we could wish for. \u201cWhat a way to bow out with the final legends slot before we take a fallow year. We cannot wait!\u201d The legends slot has become a showcase for some of the biggest names in rock gone by, giving veteran performers a chance to greet new audiences, as well as throngs of fast-aging fans. Previous big names to grace to perform in recent years include \u00a0Yusef / Cat Stevens, Shania Twain, Diana Ross, Dolly Parton, Tom Jones, Tony Bennett and James Brown. Stewart, though, will be the first artist to have headlined both the festival and the legend slot. Stewart has been performing steadily for more than 60 years, including stints in Las Vegas in recent years and a tour of the the UK with Boy George last year. But for those prepared to make the trip to the UK for Glastonbury it could be their last chance to see the rock great perform live. Last week, Stewart announced he will end \u201clarge-scale world tours\u201d, while stopping short of announcing his retirement. \u201cThis will be the end of large-scale world tours for me, but I have no desire to retire,\u201d he said in an Instagram post. \u201cI love what I do, and I do what I love. I\u2019m fit, have a full head of hair, and can run 100 metres in 18 seconds at the jolly old age of 79,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to move onto aGreat American Songbook, Swing Fevertour the year after next \u2013 smaller venues and more intimacy.

        "raw_text": "Ah, the Nationals are at it again \u2013 insisting on a policy that is against the interests of Australians living in regional and remote areas. Forced divestiture of stores by supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths could only lead to higher grocery prices in locations where the cost of transportation is high. You don\u2019t need to take my word for it \u2013 although I conducted a full review of the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct, all of whose recommendations were accepted by the Albanese government and are being implemented. My report rejected forced divestiture as a penalty for anti-competitive conduct, as has Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Rather, I recommended maximum penalties for major breaches of the mandatory code of conduct of $10 million, 10 per cent of annual turnover or three times the benefit gained, whichever is the greatest. But the Greens teamed up with the Coalition and sought to legislate forced divestiture. A decision to order divestment of stores would be for the courts, not for the government of the day or the ACCC. That\u2019s because of the separation of powers between the government and the courts, as required by the Constitution. Coles and Woolworths dominate the Australian supermarket industry. Aldi and wholesaler Metcash \u2013 which supplies IGA stores \u2013 are much smaller players. A court contemplating forcing Coles or Woolworths to sell some of its stores would ask the obvious question \u2013 who would be the prospective buyer? How would forcing Coles to sell to Woolworths, or Woolworths to Coles, fix anything? It certainly wouldn\u2019t increase competition. Advocates of forced divestiture argue Coles or Woolworths would be required to offload stores to a foreign buyer. But who says foreign supermarket chains would be interested? There\u2019s no law stopping them from entering the market now, but for better or worse, richer or poorer, they are staying away in droves. Maybe they just can\u2019t see the sense in starting up a supermarket chain in Australia, far from their home base in America or Europe? Perhaps an email from a court inviting them to Australia would do the trick, but probably not. It\u2019s true that German company Aldi moved into Australia at the turn of the century and is still here, and expanding its footprint. Maybe Coles or Woolworths could be ordered to sell some of their stores to Aldi? But Aldi has a smaller range of items than Coles and Woolworths. It is a popular chain, but many shoppers don\u2019t buy exclusively from Aldi, going instead to Coles or Woolworths to complete their weekly shopping. If Aldi wants to expand its store footprint but is being held back by restrictive state and local planning and zoning laws, those restrictions should be relaxed. Overly restrictive, anti-competitive planning and zoning laws are definitely on the Albanese government\u2019s competition policy agenda. IGA stores offer convenience and personal service, but also have a more limited range and on average are more expensive than the large supermarket chains. The biggest losers from the Nationals-Liberals-Greens forced divestiture policy would be people living in regional and remote Australia. The major supermarkets have uniform pricing policies for non-perishable items. And even for perishable fruit and vegetables and meat and fish, they can have uniform pricing for an entire state. Effectively, Coles and Woolworths shoppers in the big cities are subsidising those living in regional and remote areas, where transport costs are much greater. The ACCC\u2019s February 2025 report of its inquiry into supermarkets, having examined the uniform pricing policies of Coles and Woolworths, found that: \u201cPrices actually paid by consumers are broadly consistent with the pricing policies the supermarkets have outlined\u201d. It follows that if there was forced divestiture of the local Coles or Woolworths supermarket in a regional or remote location, shoppers in these places would be obliged to pay higher prices for their groceries, owing to higher transport costs. They no longer would benefit from the subsidies paid by their city cousins. Shire leaders in the Kimberley region of Western Australia have expressed concern about forced divestiture. Shire president Chris Mitchell said smaller retailers would find it difficult to keep the shelves filled amid high demand if bigger supermarkets were sold off. He is smarter than the average mayor, Boo Boo! The Albanese government has announced it will ensure the costs of 30 essential products in more than 76 remote stores are the same as those people paid by shoppers in the big cities. For forced divestiture to occur, the ACCC would need to recommend it to the Federal Court.The Federal Court would then need to weigh the evidence and conclude that divestiture was in the public interest and especially in the interests of shoppers at the stores that were to be sold. Shoppers in regional and remote Australia could only be disadvantaged by the forced divestiture legislation being pursued by the Nationals-Liberal-Green alliance on this. As a bipartisan policy of the Nationals and the Liberals, forced divestiture would harm voters in regional and remote Australia, but hey, it sounds tough, and it seems that\u2019s all that matters to them.

        "raw_text": "A 50-year extension to the North West Shelf (NWS) project in Western Australia would see huge amounts of gas given away with no return for Australians. While the exact volume and value is hard to predict, a basic estimate is that up to $215 billion worth of gas could be given away, royalty-free. The NWS liquefied natural gas facility, specifically the Karratha Gas Plant, producers up to 18.6 mega tonnes of LNG each year. At present, it sources around 75 per cent of its natural gas from the royalty-paying NWS gas fields off the coast of WA. These fields are the only major offshore gas project in WA that pays royalties, all others are royalty-free as the Commonwealth Government chooses not to charge a price for the public\u2019s gas. As we\u2019vepointed out before, the proponents of the NWS extension, Woodside, have not identified where all the gas will come from with major implications for WA gas prices. What is clear is that the royalty-paying NWS gas that feeds the Karratha Gas Plant is forecast to decline and it will increasingly be fed by gas from non-royalty paying reserves such as the Browse Basin, as shown in this chart that we first published here.  As shown in the above chart, it is possible that by 2036, none of the gas feeding the Karratha Gas Plant would be coming from royalty-paying reserves, although some gas could be sourced from Waitsia and other onshore or state-waters sources that would pay a royalty. Below, we conservatively assume that that 70 per cent of Karratha Gas Plant feedstock gas is royalty-free by the mid-2030s, and a price of $8 per gigajoule for gas, which is now common in WA wholesale trades. On these assumptions, the NWS shelf extension will be receiving around $5.1 billion a year in royalty-free gas, or $14 million each day, or $215 billion over the project\u2019s 46-year life. These calculations are shown in Table 1.  Across the 46-year extension of the project, a total $215 billion in free gas will be given away. For comparison, the output of the entire WA economy was $448 billion in 2024. Matt Saunders is a senior economist and Rod Campbell is research director at theAustralia Institute.",

        "raw_text": "A controversial gas project has been given the green light to keep operating for decades to come, provoking an angry response from environmental groups. New federal Environment Minister Murray Watt on Wednesday approved fossil fuel giant Woodside\u2019s proposal to extend its North West Shelf project in Western Australia. The approval, which allows Woodside to extend the project\u2019s life from 2030 to 2070, is subject to strict conditions about the impact of air emission levels from the expanded onshore gas plant at Karratha. The energy company has 10 business days to respond to the proposed decision. Watt said he would consider the response before a final decision was made. The impact of air emissions on the Murujuga rock art that forms part of the Dampier Archipelago was considered as part of the assessment process, he said. \u201cI have ensured that adequate protection for the rock art is central to my proposed decision,\u201d he said. Woodside\u2019s proposal to extend the operating life of the project has been under assessment for six years. The decision came after the release of a report indicating the United Nations will reject Australia\u2019s bid to add the Murujuga rock art to the World Heritage list. Its integrity was \u201cvulnerable due to industrial emissions, considered the majorly adversely affecting factor for the petroglyphs\u201d, the International Council on Monuments and Sites determined in its report to UNESCO. An agenda for UNESCO\u2019s meeting in July shows the draft decision will be deferred and the nomination sent back to the Australian government to address the risks to World Heritage values, including \u201cthe total removal of degrading acidic emissions currently impacting upon the petroglyphs\u201d. Australian Conservation Foundation climate campaigner Piper Rollins said the report \u201cclearly identified\u201d the North West Shelf gas hub as the primary risk to the ancient rock art. \u201cUNESCO is essentially saying to the Albanese government: you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it. You are going to have to choose between World Heritage or Woodside\u2019s toxic gas extension,\u201d she said. \u201cThe two cannot co-exist.\u201d Greenpeace Australia chief executive David Ritter said Watt\u2019s \u201cterrible decision\u201d brought Woodside\u2019s destructive gas drills one step closer to Scott Reef, a marine ecosystem that is home to threatened species such as pygmy blue whales and green sea turtles. \u201cThe North West Shelf facility is one of Australia\u2019s dirtiest and most polluting fossil fuel projects,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Albanese government\u2019s next decision on whether or not to approve Woodside\u2019s Browse proposal will show Australians the true colours of the government. We urge Minister Watt to stand up for nature and oceans and reject Woodside plans to drill at Scott Reef.\u201d Independent senator Lidia Thorpe said Watt\u2019s decision \u201ccould ignite a climate bomb\u201d and permanently destroy sacred sites, but he hadn\u2019t consulted traditional custodians and had ignored a heritage protection application lodged more than three years ago. \u201cThere is no way to justify this project \u2013 not when it will release billions of tonnes of emissions, not when we\u2019re watching Murujuga\u2019s sacred rock art being erased by pollution, and not when communities are suffering the impacts of climate collapse,\u201d Thorpe said. Watt flew to WA to meet stakeholders but refused to meet Murujuga custodians, she said. \u201cChoosing Reconciliation Week to push through this decision, while side-lining First Peoples, is not just disrespectful \u2013 it\u2019s disgraceful,\u201d she said. Watt, whose reputation as a dealmaker led to his shift into the environment portfolio, had promised to reach a decision on the extension by May 31. The federal government twice delayed a final decision until after the election, following approval from the WA government. Traditional owners have raised concerns about the impact of the expanded project on sacred rock art and launched legal action to try to compel Watt to protect the artwork. Research released by the Australia Institute showed that emissions from the planned extension would be equivalent to 33 years of Australia\u2019s entire emissions. -AAP",

        "raw_text": "Australia\u2019s inflation rate has held steady after a sharp rise in egg prices was somewhat offset by falling electricity costs. The monthly consumer price index remained at 2.4 per cent in the year ended April, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported on Wednesday. Economists had been expecting a 2.3 per cent rise. It\u2019s the third straight month that the index has held below the midpoint of the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s 2-3 per cent target range. But the central bank is unlikely to put too much stock in the headline figure, given it tends to bounce around from month to month. The bank\u2019s board places greater emphasis on less volatile quarterly inflation figures, which aren\u2019t due until the end of July, and in particular the quarterly trimmed mean, which also removes certain items from the CPI basket. The annual trimmed mean rose 2.8 per cent in April, up slightly from 2.7 in March. Price rises for food and non-alcoholic beverages slowed from 3.4 per cent to 3.1 per cent in April. They would have eased further if not for bird flu, said ABS head of prices statistics Michelle Marquardt. \u201cWhile annual inflation eased for most food categories in April, egg prices were up by 18.6 per cent in the past 12 months. This comes as supply has been affected by bird flu outbreaks,\u201d Marquardt said. Housing cost grew 0.4 percentage points faster in the 12 months to April, but new dwelling prices still rose at the slowest annual pace since April 2021 as project home builders offered discounts and promotional offers to entice business. Electricity prices fell 6.5 per cent, compared to a 9.6 per cent fall in the 12 months to March, as customers used up energy rebates in Queensland and Western Australia. The Reserve Bank predicts the trimmed mean to stay around the midpoint of its target range for the foreseeable future. RBA governor Michele Bullock retired the \u201cnarrow path\u201d analogy in her May 20 press conference following the board meeting, essentially acknowledging the battle against inflation was all but over. Her focus has turned to combating uncertainty caused by US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, with the RBA expecting the trade war to have a disinflationary impact on Australia. The board will have to wait for the second and third monthly readings of the quarter to get data on services inflation, which will show if low unemployment is flowing through to higher labour costs for businesses. \u201cOne area that the RBA had previously pointed to as a reason for not being confident that inflation can be sustained at current levels is the tightness of the labour market,\u201d said Westpac chief economist Luci Ellis. \u201cWhile it still highlighted indicators that suggested remaining tightness, the forecasts for unemployment have been lifted slightly, while those for employment and wages growth have been reduced slightly.\u201d -AAP",

        "raw_text": "As debate rages about the federal government\u2019s plan to lift the tax on earnings on superannuation balances over $3 million, it\u2019s worth revisiting why we offer super tax breaks in the first place, and why they need to be reformed. Tax breaks on super contributions mean less tax is paid on super savings than other forms of income. These tax breaks cost the federal budgetnearly $50 billion in lost revenue each year. These tax breaks boost the retirement savings of super fund members. They also ensure workers don\u2019t pay punitively high long-term tax rates on their super, since the impact of even low tax rates on savingscompounds over time. But theydisproportionately flow to older and wealthier Australians. Two-thirdsof the value of super tax breaks benefit the top 20 per cent of income-earners, who are already saving enough for their retirement. Few retirees draw down on their retirement savings as intended, and many are net savers \u2013 their super balancecontinues to grow for decadesafter they retire. By 2060, Treasury expects one-third of all withdrawals from super will be via bequests \u2013 up from one-fifth today. Superannuation in Australia was intended to help fund retirements. Instead, it has become a taxpayer-subsidised inheritance scheme. The tax breaks aren\u2019t just inequitable; they are economically unsound. Generous tax breaks for super savers mean other taxes (such as income and company taxes) must be higher to make up the forgone revenue. That means the burden falls disproportionately on younger taxpayers. The government\u2019s plan to increase the tax rate on superannuation earnings for balances exceeding $3 million from 15 per cent to 30 per cent is one modest step towards fixing these problems. The tax would only apply to the amountover$3 million, not the entire balance. This reform will affect only the top 0.5 per cent of super account holders \u2013 about80,000 people \u2013 and save more than $2 billion a yearin its first full year.  Claims that not indexing the $3 million thresholdwill result in the tax affecting most younger Australians, or that it will somehow disproportionately affect younger generations, are simply nonsense. Rather than being the biggest losers from the lack of indexation, younger Australians are the biggest beneficiaries. It means more older, wealthier Australians will shoulder some of the burden of budget repair and an ageing population. Otherwise, younger generations would bear this burden alone. The facts speak for themselves: a mere 0.5 per cent of Australians have more than $3 million in their super, and85 per cent of those are aged over 60. Even in the unlikely scenario where the threshold remains fixed until 2055 \u2013 or for 10 consecutive parliamentary terms \u2013 it would still only affectthe top 10 per centof retiring Australians. Treasurer Jim Chalmershas rightly pointed outthat it is unlikely the threshold will never be lifted. Far from abandoning the proposed $3 million threshold, the government should go further and drop the threshold to $2 million, and only then index it to inflation, saving the budget a further $1 billion a year. There is no rationale for offering such generous earnings tax breaks on super balances between $2 million and $3 million. At the very least, if the $3 million threshold is maintained, it should not be indexed until inflation naturally reduces its real value to $2 million,which is estimated to occur around 2040. Levying a higher tax rate on the earnings of large super balances is complicated by the fact existing super earnings taxes are levied at the fund level, not on individual member accounts. And it\u2019s true that levying a 15 per cent surcharge on the implied earnings of the account over the year (the change in account balance, net of contributions and withdrawals) will impose a tax on unrealised capital gains, or paper profits. Taxing capital gains as they build up removes incentives to \u201clock in\u201d investments to hold onto untaxed capital gains,as the Henry Tax Review recognised. But it can create cash flow problems for some self-managed super fund members who hold assets such as business premises or a farm in their fund. Yet there are seldom easy answers when it comes to tax changes. Most people with such substantial super balances are retirees who already maintain enough liquid assets to meet the minimum drawdown requirements. Indeed, self-managed super funds are legally obligated to have investment strategies that ensure liquidity and the ability to meet liabilities. In any case, the tax does not have to be paid from super. Australians with large super balances typically earn as much income from investments outside super. And the wealthiest 10 per cent of retirees todayrely more on income from outsidesuper than income from super. Australia faces thetwin challenges of big budget deficits and stagnant productivity. Tax reform will be needed to respond to both. Good public policy, like politics, always requires some level of compromise. Super tax breaks should exist only where they support a policy aim. And on balance, trimming unneeded super tax breaks for the wealthiest 0.5 per cent of Australians would make our super system fairer and our budget stronger.

        "raw_text": "Kmart has acknowledged the competition it faces from low-cost online retailers as it unveils a strategy to engage better with younger customers. Chinese sites like Temu and Shein, which offer fast fashion, are increasingly encroaching on Kmart\u2019s low-cost retail model \u2013 especially with Gen Z and younger Gen Alpha. Temu and Shein have joined Amazon and eBay as chief competitors to Kmart\u2019s market share. Kmart\u2019s new group managing director Aleks Spaseska has revealed the discount retailer\u2019s plan to double its turnover to $20 billion in the face of increasing competition from overseas outlets. Spaseska toldNine Newspapersthat Kmart plans tofurther develop its women\u2019s, men\u2019s and youth apparel ranges and beauty products, as well as ramping up electronics, toys and collectables. It will also deepen social media engagement as part of a broader goal to double its business in under 10 years. Expanding Kmart\u2019s popular low-cost home brand Anko is at the heart of the plan, alongside a major rethink of store layout and customer engagement. In an effort to maximise sales and promote brand loyalty with younger customers,Kmart has begun experimenting with layouts that bring clothing and beauty to the front of its outlets. \u201cThe biggest difference you\u2019ll notice is in the apparel and beauty offer in the store,\u201d Spaseska was quoted as saying. \u201cIf you go into women\u2019s apparel today, you\u2019ll see we mostly sell all the tops together, the bottoms together, the dresses together,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you walk the store in the new format, there\u2019s much more co-ordination through women\u2019s apparel, which allows customers to be much more inspired and helps with outfit building. \u201cWe\u2019ve also brought beauty to the front of the store as well.\u201d Kmart\u2019s Mount Gravatt store in Brisbane was the first to be refurbished in the new format late last year.Spaseska said the changes had already brought a sales bump. Kmart has earmarked four more stores for the layout redesign in the next month. If the changes continue to show positive results, every Kmart store will eventually be refurbished in the new style. The retailer will also focus on expanding its range of cleaning items, household accessories and appliances such as hair curlers. In the new layout, bigger items like bikes and car seats are moved off the shop floor room into storerooms for \u2018click and collect\u2019. That makes make more room for clothing and beauty products. Kmart is also opening a major new distribution centre in Sydney\u2019s west. Spaseska told News Corp she was confident discount retail chains could do well, even when better economic times return and consumers feel compelled to spend more on premium fashion, apparel, homewares and household goods. \u201cWhat we can see is that Kmart is really a brand for everyone. So we\u2019ve got very good levels of engagement across all customer demographics and across all levels, and they\u2019re spending with us, and we\u2019re seeing growth across all of those customer cohorts,\u201d she said. Wesfarmers-owned Kmart recorded in $11.1 billion in sales for the 2024 financial year with profits of almost $960 million.",

        "raw_text": "Let\u2019s face it \u2013 migration is a topic that sparks strong opinions. Some blame newcomers for high house prices and congested roads. Others say we need more migrants to keep the economy ticking over. Australia is grappling with a serious and persistent skills shortage that only migration can fix. Our universities rely heavily on the money international students bring. And yes, more people do mean more pressure on housing and infrastructure. But this isn\u2019t a simple \u201cmore migrants = bad\u201d equation. It\u2019s a tangled web of interconnected policies \u2013 migration, housing, infrastructure, and workforce \u2013 that at the moment too often get managed in isolation. That siloed approach has let our population grow faster than we can build homes or roads. We welcome more migrants to ease worker shortages and underwrite our university system, but we seemingly forget that they need homes, transport, and integration support. If we want a population policy that\u2019s sustainable \u2013 and fair \u2013 we need to plan smarter. That means acknowledging the ripple effects of big changes and putting guardrails in place to manage them. We all want affordable housing, sparkling infrastructure, fair wages, and well-integrated communities. But these goals can come under pressure if migration levels climb too quickly. That\u2019s why I believe Australia needs a national demographic strategy \u2013 a clear set of long-term targets to align housing, migration, and infrastructure policies. Even more challengingly, I want to establish a mechanism that forces government to integrate these sets of policies by creating national targets. We already accept the idea of targets when it comes to inflation. The Reserve Bank of Australia uses interest rates to keep inflation within a safe range. Sure, nobody enjoys high interest rates, but we accept them as the price of avoiding worse outcomes like runaway inflation. Why not apply a similar approach to housing, population, and infrastructure? Not by micromanaging every aspect of the economy, but by creating broad targets that trigger action when things drift too far off course. Let\u2019s start with housing. Instead of targeting fixed dollar values, we should aim to keep house prices within a sensibleincome-to-priceratio \u2013 say, four to six times the median income (today no capital city in Australia comes even close to that range). If prices rise above that range, it should trigger policy responses to cool the market. There are plenty of levers to pull \u2013 speeding up housing approvals, boosting public and built-to-rent housing developments, tackling demand-side distortions like negative gearing or foreign investment, or reforming stamp duty. Crucially, while the income-to-price ratio remains too high, we\u2019d hit pause on policies that are proven to drive up prices \u2013 like first-home buyer grants or letting people raid their super to buy a house. Once prices fall back within the target range, the interventions could be gradually rolled back. Yes, this would be a long-term project \u2013 think 20-plus years \u2013 and yes, it would be unpopular at first with home-owning voters. But just like we tolerate temporary pain from high interest rates to keep inflation in check, we might just learn to accept modest house price declines in exchange for long-term housing affordability. This target could also be backed by a commitment to grow public housing. Right now, public housing makes up just 4 per cent of homes. Aiming to lift that to 10 per cent would help clear waitlists and ease pressure in the broader market. Requiring a bigger slice of new housing to be set aside for social housing would slowly rebuild this crucial safety net. The second target should focus on Australia\u2019sdependency ratio\u2013 the balance between people of working age and those who aren\u2019t. As Baby Boomers age and demand for aged care ramps up, we\u2019ll need a much bigger workforce to support them. Setting a target range for the dependency ratio would let us fine-tune migration settings. We could aim for younger, permanent migrants to help slow the ageing of our population. Right now we have lots of people in their 30s, but fewer in their 20s. Migration can help smooth out those age gaps. This approach would also reflect the temporary nature of international student migration. Most students (five out of six) head home after graduation, so they do little to shift long-term demographic trends. A demographic strategy would help ensure our migration mix delivers what we need \u2013 we would work towards a desired population age profile. I\u2019m not calling for a command-and-control economy. What I\u2019m proposing is a common-sense strategy \u2013 a coordinated set of long-term goals that guide migration, housing, and infrastructure decisions. We already use this approach with monetary policy. The RBA doesn\u2019t run the whole economy, but it does use interest rates to keep inflation in check. Why not apply the same thinking to other parts of national policy? To work, this strategy should be managed by an independent, non-partisan group of public servants. These technocrats would match migration levels with workforce needs, housing supply, and infrastructure planning. That way, we could move beyond knee-jerk political responses and start making real, long-term progress. Getting bipartisan support won\u2019t be easy. But as our population ages and housing pressure builds, the need for a coordinated plan will only grow. Australia can either take control of its demographic destiny \u2013 or keep lurching from one crisis to the next. Simon Kuestenmacher is a co-founder of The Demographics Group.

        "raw_text": "Australia\u2019s short-term rental market is sizzling hot. \u2018\u2018Australia\u2019s short-term rental markets are absolutely exploding,\u2019\u2019 AirDNA chief economist Jamie Lane said. \u2018\u2018While other investors squabble over traditional long-term rentals with their predictable but uninspiring 3 per cent to 4 per cent yields, STR investors are quietly pocketing returns that would make stock market enthusiasts green with envy.\u2019\u2019 According to AirDNA\u2019s latest report on the most profitable Airbnb markets for 2025, the biggest earners for holiday investors aren\u2019t the usual urban suspects like Sydney or Melbourne. Instead, regional hotspots are stealing the show, thanks to strong domestic demand, low competition, and smart pricing strategies. Using annual revenue potential as the ranking metric, the study included any market with 100 or more listings for a comprehensive view of the STR market in Australia. Taking out the top spot in this year\u2019s rankings is the Whitsundays, boasting an impressive annual revenue potential of $141,372. While its average daily rate (ADR) of $602 is among the highest nationally, it\u2019s the RevPAR (revenue per available rental) of $414 \u2013 the top figure in Australia \u2013 that really seals the deal. \u2018\u2018This archipelago of 74 islands within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park attracts diverse tourists year-round. Airlie Beach serves as the gateway to attractions like world-famous Whitehaven Beach,\u2019\u2019 said Lane. A combination of aspirational appeal and consistent bookings has cemented its place as a premier short-term rental investment. While high ADR might seem like a clear path to big profits, the data tells a more nuanced story. Take Singleton in the Hunter Valley, for instance, which reports a staggering ADR of $862 \u2013 the highest in the country \u2013 but ranks second overall in profitability with $116,033 in potential revenue. Similarly, Cessnock, also in the Hunter, has the third-highest ADR of $676, but comes in fourth place on the list generating nearly $96,621 annually. These are still excellent returns, but ultra-high pricing means properties must maintain top-tier appeal and service to justify the cost. It\u2019s also true that the higher the nightly rate, the smaller your potential renter pool and therefore yearly occupancy \u2013 and consistent occupancy can have greater impact than peak pricing when it comes to overall returns. \u2018\u2018While ADR might seem like the star of the show, it\u2019s actually more of a supporting character. Yes, charging $500/night sounds impressive, but if your property sits vacant half the year, you\u2019re leaving money on the table,\u2019\u2019 said Lane. \u2018\u2018The real magic happens at the intersection of price and demand \u2013 finding that sweet spot where your calendar stays full without unnecessarily discounting your property\u2019s value.\u2019\u2019 Exmouth in Western Australia claims the third spot, with revenue potential of $101,976 \u2013 a figure driven by strong seasonal demand and limited rental supply. This dynamic allows owners to command high rates during peak periods while avoiding oversaturation. \u2018\u2018This remote coastal town serves as the gateway to Ningaloo Reef, one of the world\u2019s largest fringing reefs and a UNESCO World Heritage site. Exmouth\u2019s primary appeal comes from seasonal attractions like whale shark swimming (March-July) and humpback whale watching (August-October),\u2019\u2019 said Lane. \u2018\u2018The destination\u2019s limited accommodation supply and strong demand contribute to its solid RevPAR performance.\u2019\u2019 Meanwhile, Byron Bay, a consistent Airbnb performer, rounds out the top five with $95,004 in annual earnings. Despite the STR market here being heavily saturated, what keeps Byron competitive is its strong domestic appeal, high pricing power and a steady flow of visitors year-round. \u2018\u2018Iconic Byron Bay ranks fifth with $95K annual revenue potential and Australia\u2019s third-highest RevPAR at $324,\u2019\u2019 said Lane. \u2018\u2018Byron\u2019s appeal stems from its stunning beaches, laid-back atmosphere, thriving food scene, and retreats and spas.\u2019\u2019 A key trend across all the top markets is the role of domestic travellers. With many Australians continuing to explore regional destinations post-pandemic, coastal towns and wine regions are enjoying sustained occupancy. International travellers \u2013 led by New Zealand, the US, and the UK \u2013 are returning, but it\u2019s the local market that\u2019s keeping these regional destinations profitable. For those eyeing a slice of the short-term rental market, the message is clear: A high nightly rate doesn\u2019t always equal the best investment. Instead, look to regions with steady demand, low competition, and strong RevPAR. From the beaches of Queensland to the vineyards of the Hunter, regional Australia continues to offer some of the country\u2019s most compelling investment opportunities.

        "raw_text": "Insurance within super \u2013 at what stage should you discontinue it? As you get towards retirement age, premiums get dearer and your fund balance increases to the extent that a death benefit is not needed. This can be a tricky question and there is no black and white answer. Insurance within super provides you with at least some cover should you die or become totally or temporarily disabled. You make some good points though. Premiums do get a lot more expensive when you are older. Especially from the mid-50s onwards. This is, of course, due to the fact you are far more likely to make a claim as you get older. Depending on your fund and the type of cover, most super funds stop your policy between mid-60s and age 70. You should make a conscious decision about whether you want to keep your policy, and if yes, the amount of cover. Some things to consider when making your decision: It\u2019s a trade-off between being fully covered versus building your super to have a nice retirement. The answer may not be all or nothing, you could decide to just dial back some of your cover. Many super funds can provide you with personal advice about the insurance that you hold with them. The advice is often covered by your membership fee and no additional fee would be payable. You should consider speaking with your fund about this. I\u2019m62 years old with a part-time job earning around $25,000 a year. I get a supplementfrom Jobseeker and have a pensioner card. I\u2019m looking to downsize soon and with some of the extra funds I would like to pay off both my daughters\u2019 HECS fees. This would be around $40,000-$45,000. Is there a way of doing this that won\u2019t penalise any of us tax-wise or my Jobseeker payment? Or would it be better to just stick to gifting them a smaller amount over a few years? There is no negative tax consequence in what you are proposing. However, Centrelink would consider this gifting and it would be caught under their deprivation rules. Deprivation arises where a person disposes (gifts), destroys or diminishes the value of an asset or income without receiving adequate financial consideration. Under social security legislation, amounts exceeding the \u2018disposal-free areas\u2019 are treated as a deprived asset. They are then assessed for five years from the date of the relevant disposal. The disposal free areas are $10,000 in a financial year or $30,000 over any rolling five financial-year period. Anything above that is still considered an asset that is owned by yourself for five years. Therefore, you can pay off $45,000 in your daughters\u2019 HECS debt. You would not see any reduction in your benefits, but $35,000 would still be considered an asset owned by yourself for the next five years. You may even receive a small increase in payments from Centrelink because you have $10,000 less. The main takeout is don\u2019t leave yourself short. You will no longer have access to these funds and would only receive a minimal increase in support payments. When you make a downsizer contribution into a super account, i-s it classed as non-concessional and forms part of the tax-free component? If so, upon death, do my non-dependent children claim my super tax-free? \u2018Down-sizer super\u2019 contributions do not count under the concessional (pre-tax) or non-concessional (post-tax) caps. They have their own category and cap, which is $300,000. If you have a spouse, then each partner can make up to $300,000 in down-sizer contributions from the sale of one residence. These contributions go into the \u2018tax-free\u2019 component of your super. Therefore, no tax would be payable when paid out as a death benefit, regardless of who it is paid to.

        "raw_text": "With everything happening in the world, it is probably easy to miss what is apparently becoming one of the Greatest Issues Of Our Time. It\u2019s not addressing the housing affordability crisis, which has shown that rental stress is at record highs, social housing doesn\u2019t come close to meeting demand, and safe and affordable housing is becoming a luxury. It\u2019s not raising the rate or ending mutual obligations or ensuring that we actually do lift people out of poverty, a test we carried out during the pandemic and proved we can achieve quite simply, if there is the will. And it\u2019s not only climate, which is about to get another kick in the guts domestically with Labor to approve the 50-year expansion of Woodside\u2019s North West Shelf project \u2013 which will add the equivalent of a dozen coal-fired power stations of emissions to the atmosphere, increase domestic costs for Western Australians and further erode priceless rock art that survived an ice age. It\u2019s not even Australia\u2019s continued absenteeism in responding to Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza. No, it\u2019s none of those. It\u2019s even bigger. Are you ready? It\u2019s \u2026 very rich people being asked to pay a tiny bit of tax on a small percentage of the earnings on their wealth. Yup. Labor\u2019s very modest super changes. Which it announced in the last term of parliament but said it wouldn\u2019t move on until this term, to give the 80,000 or so people this will impact time to get used to paying a tiny bit of extra tax. (Or receiving a lower tax break, depending on how you look at things.) It\u2019s a whopping 0.5 per cent of the population we are talking about here. According to the tax office, the average income of someone with $3 million in their super is $381,000. If you have more than $5 million in superannuation, your average income is about $495,000. And if you are one of the handful with more than $20 million in your super, your average income is just short of $1.3 million. We\u2019re not exactly talking Jan and Joe Average here. Oh, but maybe one day you COULD have $3 million in your super and then you too will be subjected to having to pay a tiny bit of tax on earnings above that $3 million balance. Not the balance itself \u2013 just the earnings on the capital above $3 million. Let\u2019s say that COULD be you, or your children. And yes, sure, one day in 20 or 30 years, it COULD impact more people. Think you might one day have $3m in your super & be affected by the super tax changes? Ok, you are 18yo, you just got a job \u2013 it pays\u2026 $150k!Give yourself a 3.7% annual pay rise.Never take time off for study, kids or illness. You will retire with $3,017,016 moneysmart.gov.au/how-super-wo\u2026 [image or embed] \u2014 Greg Jericho (@grogsgamut.bsky.social)23 May 2025 at 13:18  Putting aside the fact that no one seems to care how any other policy is going to impact future generations in two or three decades, let\u2019s meet Prudence. Unlike most 18 year olds, Prudence is very worried about her superannuation balance and has spent a lot of time reading Tim Wilson\u2019s socials, so Prudence is heading into the labour market ready to do battle. For Prudence to retire with $3 million, she has to earn at least $150,000 a year right off the bat. Then she needs to secure at least a 3.7 per cent annual pay rise. And no time off, Prudence! No unpaid leave time for you! If she does all of that, she will retire with just over $3 million in her super account. Thoughts and prayers for Prudence then (assuming that the same legislation has remained in place and untouched for her entire working life), for she will receive a slightly lower tax break (or a slightly higher tax applied, again depending on how you look at it) on the earnings above her $3 million balance. That\u2019s a huge amount to take in. Better not do anything then, because poor Prudence! Hilariously, the AFR is showing just how absurd is the scare campaign against the super tax changes. They give an eg where someone\u2019s super goes from $2m to $3.18m in a year! Yep a $1.18m increase. How much extra tax? $1,528! OMG!! THAT\u2019S OUTRAG\u2026 err\u2026 oh actually that\u2019s bugger all [image or embed] \u2014 Greg Jericho (@grogsgamut.bsky.social)23 May 2025 at 10:04  Some of the criticisms have been truly ridiculous. It\u2019s not going to impact investment, or the start-up sector, or even farmers (someone would have put their farm into their superannuation only to pay less tax. It is not the responsibility of the Australian people to keep subsidising wealthy people\u2019s assets). What it is going to do, is tax the rich. Just a tiny, tiny, tiny bit more.It\u2019s a slightly lower tax concession for people who have more money than you could ever need to retire, who want to maintain their tax breaks. We know that self-managed super funds are popular as tax avoidance mechanisms and estate planning vehicles. These very small changes are just addressing some of the vast imbalances in wealth in this country, where rich people can move assets and wealth into whatever provides them with the best tax break, abusing systems built to ensure a fair retirement, not non-stop wealth accumulation. And the rich people are very annoyed at being asked to pay a tiny bit more tax than they planned to. Finance professor Mark Humphery-Jenner told theAustralian Financial Reviewthat it was \u201cmoral repugnance [to target] someone merely because they are wealthy\u201d. But the fact is, it is morally repugnant to NOT tax the rich. Especially now. A recent ANU study found that the pre-tax income of Australians aged over 60 was equal to the average mid-career income of 65 per cent of the working population (and much higher than most workers aged between 18 and 30). That\u2019s been fuelled by government policy in the past couple of decades, which has led to older generations earning significantly more private income \u201cprimarily as a result of higher capital income from real estate and superannuation\u201d. Put simply, previous generations have enjoyed tax breaks and policies that have helped them amass wealth younger generations can only dream of. And now people are complaining they might receive a slightly lower tax concession on part of that wealth. Apparently we all need to be very worried about budget deficits and the need for structural reform \u2013 but only if modestly addressing it doesn\u2019t make rich people upset. It\u2019s very telling that the critics of this modest policy have used farmers as the poster group for who might be harmed. That\u2019s because they know if they showed you someone in Double Bay or Cottesloe (where the median incomes are $428,489 and $365,588) no one would care. And rightly so. The legislation will be Labor\u2019s first big test in the new parliament. Not because it\u2019s bad policy, but because it upsets people who are not used to being the target of government cuts. Perhaps they could go chat to someone on JobSeeker or the minimum wage for tips to adjust their budgets.",

Even if you haven\u2019t seen a cent of that money in your pocket,\u201d the caption says. The post continues: \u201cUnrealised income tax is just one more way they\u2019ll trap you in financial slavery.\u201d \u201cYou work hard. You save. You invest. And they want to control and tax it all.\u201d The Instagram video\u2019s overlay text also says: \u201cThe Aus government is about to tax you on money you haven\u2019t even made yet\u201d. However, this is false as the changes only apply to superannuation accounts with balances of more than $3 million. The Albanese governmentintroduced laws in 2023that changed the concessional arrangements on superannuation earnings for accounts valued over $3 million. Currently, earnings on superannuation accounts in the accumulation phase, when money is being contributed prior to retirement, are taxed at a concessional rate of up to 15 per cent. Under the proposed changes(p3), super accounts will be subject to an additional 15 per cent tax on a proportion of earnings corresponding to the share of the super balance exceeding $3 million. The reforms remain before the Senate, but are expected to pass with the support of the Greens when parliament resumes from July 22. The government has previously estimatedthat about 0.5 per cent of superannuation accounts \u2013 about 80,000 \u2013 will be subject to the changes. Commentators have raised concerns that the policy could open the door to wider \u201cwealth taxes\u201d, but in its current form, it does not apply to all unrealised gains. A Treasury spokesperson pointed AAP FactCheckto the 2023 policy announcement. \u201cMore than 99.5 per cent of Australians will continue to receive the same generous tax breaks that help them save more for retirement through superannuation,\u201d the release said. \u201cThe 0.5 per cent of individuals with superannuation accounts over $3 million will receive less generous tax breaks for balances that are beyond what is necessary to fund a comfortable retirement.\u201d AAP FactCheck is an accredited member of the International Fact-Checking Network.

        "raw_text": "In a bold move not seen since the height of Covid-19, the Reserve Bank of Australia has delivered two rate cuts in three meetings, bringing the official cash rate down to 3.85 per cent. The decision, anticipated by 88 per cent of experts inFinder\u2019s RBA Cash Rate Survey, aims to ease mortgage stress and stimulate broader economic activity. \u201cFrankly, two cuts might not be enough to ease the spike in mortgage stress we\u2019ve seen since rates started climbing again in May 2022,\u201d Finder head of consumer research Graham Cooke said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a step in the right direction and great news for home owners. It\u2019s two down and maybe two more to go this year.\u201d If those additional cuts materialise, borrowers could save up to $5,044 a year, assuming lenders pass on the reductions in full. Cooke also noted the value of proactively shopping around: \u201cThere\u2019s a 40-point difference between the average and lowest rates available. You could effectively give yourself two rate cuts by refinancing.\u201d Chris Bates, CEO ofAlcove Mortgage Brokers, said borrowers should take action now. \u201cThere\u2019s a refinance war brewing behind the scenes, with banks offering amazing pricing when you\u2019re looking to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to reach out to your lender or a broker, they\u2019re aggressively competing to retain customers.\u201d Changes to HECS, including a 25 per cent debt reduction and exclusion from mortgage assessments, combined with increased borrowing capacity (up around 2.5 per cent) are creating new opportunities for first-home buyers.  However, any newfound power may be offset by rapidly rising property prices. \u201cThere\u2019s increased interest across the board since the first cut and the more that happens, the more it will build,\u201d Bates said. \u201cHowever, upgraders are still very hesitant to take action under higher rates. If there are significant cuts with confidence that they will stay low, upgraders will come back strongly, as many families are not in the right property to suit their situation long term, and it makes sense to upgrade your home to a better tax-free growth asset.\u201d \u201cBuyers are still out and about, which is reflected in auction clearance rates consistently holding above 60 per cent,\u201dLJ Hookerresearch head Mathew Tiller said. \u201cThe decision by the RBA to reduce rates won\u2019t shoot the lights out in the market by any means, as there are still affordability pressures due to recent price growth. But we anticipate seeing demand pick up as confidence returns. With more cuts expected, buyers will be looking to get in before rates fall further and demand strengthens.\u201d Yet broader economic risks are still in play, including international headwinds. \u201cThe big unknown remains how Trump\u2019s tariffs will impact Australia\u2019s inflation rate,\u201d saidNerida Conisbee, chief economist at Ray White. \u201cSupply chain disruptions and global pricing shifts could increase costs, though this might be offset by cheaper Chinese exports as they seek new markets. The RBA will be watching this closely.\u201d Conisbee said that while Australia\u2019s property market had historically weathered global shocks (such as the global financial crisis and Covid-19) a repeat of the 2021 boom was unlikely. \u201cThe market is strengthening, but we\u2019re in a very different financial environment. During Covid, the cash rate hit 0.1 per cent and households were flush with savings. Today, the cost of living remains high, savings are lower, and rates won\u2019t fall anywhere near those pandemic-era lows.\u201d She said that while price growth should continue, it would likely be more moderate and sustainable.

        "raw_text": "The Reserve Bank of Australiacut the official interest ratefor the second time this year, as it lowered forecasts for Australian economic growth and pointed to increasing uncertainty in the world economy. The bank lowered thecash rate targetby 0.25 per cent, from 4.1 per cent to 3.85 per cent, saying inflation is expected to remain in the target band. All the big four banks swiftly passed the cut on to households with mortgages. This will save a household with a $500,000 loan about $80 a month. Announcing the cut, the Reserve Bankstressedin its accompanying statement it stands ready to reduce rates again if the economic outlook deteriorates sharply. The board considered a severe downside scenario and noted that monetary policy is well placed to respond decisively to international developments if they were to have material implications for activity and inflation in Australia. The latestConsumer Price Indexshowed that inflation remained around the middle of the Reserve Bank\u2019smedium-term target band of 2-3 per centin the March quarter. The Reserve Bank was also comforted by the underlying inflation measure called the \u201ctrimmed mean\u201d. This measure excludes items with the largest price movements up or down. The bank noted that it has returned to the 2-3 per cent target band for the first time since 2021. This suggests inflation is not just temporarily low due to temporary factors such as the electricity price rebates.  In February, RBA governor Michele Bullockconcededthe bank had arguably been \u201clate raising interest rates on the way up\u201d. It did not want to be late on the way down. Perhaps Bullock is being unduly modest. The central bank looks to have judged well the extent of monetary tightening. It did not raise interest rates as much as its peers, but still got inflation back to the target.  Last week, we got anupdateon the strength of the labour market. Unemployment stayed at 4.1 per cent. It has now been around 4 per cent since late 2023, a remarkable achievement. This is below the 4.5 per cent the Reserve Bank hadregardedas the level consistent with steady inflation (in economic jargon, theNAIRU). But neither prices norwageshave accelerated.  In its updatedforecasts, the bank sees headline inflation dropping to 2.1 per cent by mid-year but going back to 3.0 per cent by the end of the year, as the electricity subsidies are removed. By mid-2027, it will be back near the middle of the 2-3 per cent target. Underlying inflation is forecast to stay around the middle of the target band throughout. The Reserve Bank cut its forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) to 2.1 per cent by December, down from its previous forecast of 2.4 per cent made in February. It said: Economic policy uncertainty has increased sharply alongside recent global developments, and this is expected to prompt some households to increase their precautionary savings and some businesses to postpone some investment decisions. The unemployment rate is expected to increase to 4.3 per cent by the end of the year and remain there through 2026. Cost-of-living pressures look set to ease, as real household disposable income grows faster than population. As the Reserve Bank governor told a media conference on Tuesday: There\u2019s now a new set of challenges facing the economy, but with inflation declining and the unemployment rate relatively low, we\u2019re well positioned to deal with them. The board remains prepared to take further action if that is required. The main uncertainty in the global economy is how the trade war instigated by US President Donald Trump will play out.According to one count, he has announced new or revised tariff policies about 50 times. \u201cThe outlook for the global economy has deteriorated since the February statement. This is due to the adverse impact on global growth from higher tariffs and widespread economic and policy unpredictability,\u201d the bank noted. The US tariff pauses on the highest rates on China and most other nations are due to be in place for 90 days. But more measures may be announced before then. This uncertainty is likely to be stifling trade, and even more so investment decisions by companies in the face of rapidly changing policies. And it will weaken the global economy. In herpress conference, Bullock said the board\u2019s judgment was that \u201cglobal trade developments will overall be disinflationary for Australia\u201d. Not only is the global outlook weaker, but some goods no longer being sold to the US could be diverted to Australia. The Reserve Bank\u2019s updatedforecastsassume interest rates will fall further, to 3.4 per cent by the end of the year. But this is just a reflection of whatfinancial markets are implying. It is not necessarily what the bank itselfexpectsto do. It is certainty not apromiseof what they will do. But the Reserve Bank still regards its stance as \u201crestrictive\u201d, or weighing on growth. So if it continues to believe inflation will stay within the target band, or the global outlook deteriorates, it will cut rates further.

        "raw_text": "Australia\u2019s big four banks have been quick to confirm they will pass on Tuesday\u2019s official interest rate cut to borrowers. The banks took less than an hour after theReserve Bank confirmed it had cut rates by a quarter of a percentage pointto announce they would reduce their own variable rates. The widely anticipated decision, as the RBA flagged concerns about global economic uncertainty, follows a first 25 basis point-cut in February. It brings the official cash rate down to 3.85 per cent. It\u2019s the first time the key interest rate has had a three in front of it in two years. \u201cToday\u2019s decision will help to deliver some much-needed additional relief for many Australians with a mortgage,\u201d said Angus Sullivan, group executive retail banking services at the Commonwealth Bank, Australia\u2019s largest home lender. \u201cWhen combined with the February rate cut, this change should free up some more cash flow for homeowners who need it. We know many have had tighter budgets in recent months and will welcome that additional flexibility.\u201d Borrowers with a median mortgage of $600,000 can expect to pay about $90 less a month in interest repayments. The CBA said its customers on average $500,000 loans would save $80 a month. Treasurer Jim Chalmers said it was very welcome relief for millions of Australians. \u201cWhen it comes to inflation, both headline and underlying inflation are now both in the Reserve Bank\u2019s target band for the first time in almost four years,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first time since records began that we\u2019ve got the unemployment rate in the low fours at the same time as we\u2019ve got both measures of inflation in the target band at the same time. \u201cWe know that the job is not finished we know that there\u2019s more work to do, but this is a very good development and we welcome it.\u201d In her post-meeting statement, RBA governor Michele Bullock said the central bank board acknowledged it had been a tough time for many Australians. \u201cBut it was essential we brought inflation down because inflation hurts everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cThe strategy that we took to achieve this was different to that of some other central banks, who took rates much higher than we did. The board accepted the trade off that, leaving the cash rate where it was would bring inflation down more gradually, but without a big increase in unemployment \u2013 a sharp rise in unemployment would have been very costly for families and for the Australian economy.\u201d Money markets and most economists had tipped the cut ahead of the RBA board\u2019s announcement, citing moderating inflation, sluggish consumer spending and a dour economic growth outlook fuelled by trade uncertainty. The consumer price index for the March quarter remained steady at 2.4 per cent, while trimmed mean inflation, which removes volatile price movements, dropped to 2.9 per cent. Both measures are within the Reserve Bank\u2019s target band of 2-3 per cent. But stronger-than-expected unemployment and wages growth, as well as a pause in trade hostilities between the US and China, reduced the urgency for the RBA to remove monetary restrictiveness. \u201cSince our last meeting [in April], global economic and policy uncertainty has increased substantially following tariff announcements by the US administration,\u201d Bullock said. \u201cThe response of its trading partners and subsequent changes to the policies, including various bilateral agreements and deals \u2013 it\u2019s been a complete roller-coaster.\u201d The board judged that the global trade turmoil would be disinflationary in Australia. \u201cHowever, there is a risk to inflation on the other side; the trade policies could lead to supply chain issues, which could raiseprices for some imports, much as we saw during the pandemic,\u201d Bullock said. \u201cWe\u2019ll also need to be alert to such upside risks.\u201d In its quarterly update to its economic forecasts, the RBA lowered its prediction for underlying inflation from 2.7 per cent to 2.6 per cent by the middle of the year, as a result of Donald Trump\u2019s trade war. Australia\u2019s economy is tipped to grow 0.3 percentage points slower in 2025 at 2.1 per cent, while inflation is expected to peak 0.1 percentage higher at 4.3 per cent. -with AAP",

        "raw_text": "Households struggling with hefty mortgage payments have scored another win with the Reserve Bank announcing a further cut to official interest rates. The central bank\u2019s 25 basis point-cut in the official cash rate to 3.85 per cent, announced on Tuesday afternoon, had been widely predicted by economists. The announcement, which came at the end of the bank board\u2019s two-day meeting, is only the second cut to mortgage interest rates in Australia in almost five years. Assuming banks pass the latest cut on in full, it will mean the median mortgage-holder with a $600,000 debt will pay about $90 less a month in interest. It follows February\u2019s landmark first cut and the decisionat the RBA\u2019s pre-election meeting in early April for another pause. It takes rates to their lowest level since May 2023. In its statement after the decision was released, the RBA board noted inflation had fallen \u201csubstantially\u201d since its peak in 2022. \u201cData on inflation for the March quarter provided further evidence that inflation continues to ease,\u201d it said. However, it also noted that global uncertainty had spiked in the past three months and there was still \u201cconsiderable uncertainty\u201d around tariffs \u2013 such as those imposed by US President Donald Trump. \u201cThe board assesses that this move will make monetary policy somewhat less restrictive. It nevertheless remains cautious about the outlook, particularly given the heightened level of uncertainty about both aggregate demand and supply,\u201d it said. Earlier, Finance Minister Katy Gallagher said homeowners would have been keenly awaiting the latest interest rate ruling,\u00a0 adding that a fall in inflation levels was a positive sign. \u201cWe know inflation has come back into band \u2026 and that is a welcome progress that has been made over the last two years,\u201d she told ABC TV on Tuesday. \u201cWe know that has been hard for households.\u201d Inflation for the March quarter remained steady at 2.4 per cent, while underlying inflation, which removes volatile price movements, dropped to 2.9 per cent. Both measures are within the Reserve Bank\u2019s target band of 2-3 per cent. Nicola Powell, chief economist at property portal Domain, said Tuesday\u2019s interest rate cut was pretty much a given. As well as moderating inflation and sluggish consumer spending, US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs have bolstered the case for a cut to support the Australian economy, amid an anticipated global slowdown. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s going to be at the forefront of their mind, the impact that that is going to have on the domestic economy,\u201d Powell said. Gallagher said that prices remained high, despite progress on inflation. \u201cSome of those really high peaks in inflation really hit household budgets, and people felt it when they went to the supermarket, when they paid their bills,\u201d she said. \u201cWe get the job isn\u2019t done either and that we\u2019ve got to continue our focus, not only on inflation but also on productivity on that side of the economy over the next couple of years.\u201d Given the widespread expectations of a rate cut have now been met, market attention has quickly turned to the Reserve Bank\u2019s statement and governor Michele Bullock for signs of where the board is likely to go next. How much Bullock pushes back on market pricing of the cash rate, as she did following the February decision, will feed into investor confidence of further cuts. She is due to address the media later on Tuesday. -with AAP",

        "raw_text": "We humans understand the world best in comparison. A single number means little unless we can anchor it to something familiar. That\u2019s why in my columns you always see me benchmark data across time, place, people, and purpose. Without these anchors, stats are just stray numbers drifting in space. In my writing and on stage as a public speaker I learned that Australiansloveknowing how we compare to other countries. When international benchmarking enters the chat, the usual suspects are the US, UK, Canada, and New Zealand. We speak the same language (more or less), share colonial histories, and have a cultural closeness that makes comparisons feel natural. But if we only ever look at our cousins, we miss bigger, bolder lessons. Australia often looks to the US as both an inspiration and a cautionary tale. As the global economic and cultural superpower, the US sets most of the trends that shape Australian media, tech, and policy debates. From healthcare models to university fees to homeownership rates, comparisons with the US help Australians understand where we align with or diverge from a more individualistic, market-driven society. The UK is Australia\u2019s historical reference point \u2013 our legal system, parliamentary democracy and even many place names trace back to Britain. Social norms, class structures, and policy legacies often mirror British roots. When Australians debate housing affordability, education models, or public broadcasting, it\u2019s natural to look at how the \u201cmother country\u201d is managing similar challenges. Canada is Australia\u2019s policy twin in many ways. We\u2019re both vast, resource-rich, sparsely populated countries with multicultural cities and strong historical ties to the British Crown. Canada gives us a glimpse of how similar nations tackle immigration, healthcare, and climate policy \u2013 often in ways that feel more European in tone. Comparing ourselves to Canada feels like comparing two parallel experiments in liberal democracy (albeit one experiment has much better beaches). New Zealand is Australia\u2019s sibling in both geography and culture. We share close economic ties, a trans-Tasman labour market, and similar education and health systems. When one country tweaks a policy, the other watches closely. Whether it\u2019s housing reform, Indigenous reconciliation, or pandemic management, the Kiwi benchmark is impossible to ignore. Whenever I write a column, it\u2019s these four benchmark nations that I am immediately drawn to \u2013 for good reason I would say. After a while, using the same four benchmarks becomes a bit boring. I want a to spice up my life. I want new benchmarks! Let\u2019s widen the lens. Let\u2019s find some new countries weshouldcompare Australia to more often. It might seem like an odd match at first, but Brazil and Australia are more alike than you\u2019d think. Both are vast countries with largely uninhabitable interiors (rainforest in Brazil\u2019s case, Outback desert in ours). We\u2019re both resource powerhouses, relying heavily on agricultural and mining exports. We worship sport (Brazil has football; we have\u2026 everything), and we\u2019re beach-obsessed coastal dwellers with sunny climates and laid-back vibes. When looking at emerging markets, Brazil is a useful mirror. It can be a useful cautionary tale when telling stories about Australia\u2019s declining middle class, the lack of social cohesion, and worsening inequality. We can also look up to Brazil as the nation manages a more complex economy than Australia. Brazil diversified its industrial base, producing and exporting more complex goods like automobiles, aircraft (Embraer), machinery, and pharmaceuticals. Here is a simple lesson for Australia: Don\u2019t just dig and ship. Build and export too. Complexity creates resilience. For Australia to increase its industrial output at least a little bit, energy costs would of course need to fall dramatically. In certain Australian policy circles, Sweden is omnipresent.We often invoke it when discussing welfare models, parental leave, or housing cooperatives. But unlike Australia, Sweden is compact, cold and cohesive in ways we\u2019re not. Comparing ourselves to Sweden reveals our deeper policy choices: we tax less, spend less on social services, and build fewer apartments. Sweden however is a constant reminder that different choices are possible. The mere existence of Sweden (even if we created some sort of fantasy version of Sweden in our heads) is useful to writers like me as we can make readers see that a radically different approach is possible. Granted, in recent years it became less popular to draw on Israel as a comparison. Extremely unique in its history and geopolitical role, there truly is no country similar to Israel. The nation remains a great case study for what can happen when you heavily invest in innovation, tech, and research and development. For all our talk of \u201cvalue-added exports\u201d and moving beyond dig-and-ship economics, Israel shows what it takes \u2013 a long-term investment in education, risk-taking startups and a healthy dose of national ambition. Benchmarking against Israel challenges Australia to think bigger and reminds us that footloose industries really can be setup anywhere in the world. Australia has great lifestyle, wonderful beaches, and a great international reputation to attract tech workers and emerging businesses from the US and other high-tech centres. If we (rather miraculously) were to offer affordable housing and less stringent regulatory frameworks for startups, I truly believe a sizeable tech sector could be established in Australia. The little city-state that could. Singapore gets name-dropped in every conversation about smart infrastructure, public housing, intergenerational living and urban planning. In many ways it\u2019s not a fair comparison as Singapore is tiny, tightly controlled and operates under a niche political setup. However, comparing ourselves to Singapore exposes our planning inefficiencies. Where we sprawl, they stack. Where we debate endlessly, they execute. Where we think short-term, they think long-term. Singapore is a benchmark in doing things at scale and speed. Sometimes a country is a very useful benchmark for no other reason than the writer having detailed local knowledge. I was born, raised and educated in Germany. My birth nation is a valuable benchmark for Australia when it comes to advanced manufacturing and vocational education. Any discussion about advancing Australia\u2019s manufacturing sector is shot down by pointing to our high wages. Germany shows what a high-wage country can achieve by investing in engineering, apprenticeships and value-added production. Germany proves that it\u2019s at least possible to maintain global competitiveness without racing to the bottom on wages. For Australia, benchmarking against Germany highlights that our \u201cdig and ship\u201d approach could be complemented by an emerging \u201cdesign and build\u201d approach. Next time you see a statistic about Australia, ask yourself: Compared to when? Compared to where? Compared to whom? That\u2019s how we turn numbers into narratives, and that\u2019s how we make sense of the world.Benchmarked data turns into a story. Without a benchmark, it remains but a fact without context.

People born between July 1, 1960, and June 30, 1964, have differing preservation ages under changes announced in the 1990s that were progressively phased in. But by July 1, 2024, everyone born during that period had turned 60, meaning Australia\u2019s preservation age is effectively 60 for all. ATO deputy commissioner Emma Rosenzweig said claims that the age would change from June 2025 were unfounded. \u201cThis is classic fake news,\u201d she said in a statement to AAP FactCheck. Rosenzweig urged people to consider the source of information they see about changes to superannuation. If in doubt, they should check trusted sources such as the ATO website or their super fund website, registered tax agent or licensed financial adviser. \u201cThink twice before acting on information heard from third-party sources, including non-official websites or on social media,\u201d she said. One change to super that will kick in from July 1, 2025, relates to the super guarantee \u2013 the percentage of a worker\u2019s wage employers are required to pay into superannuation accounts From then, the super guarantee will rise from 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent, the ATO website said.

        "raw_text": "Qantas should be forced to pay the maximum penalty of $121 million for illegally outsourcing the roles of 1800 ground workers, to send a strong message to all companies, a union says. Justice Michael Lee is set to decide the penalty Qantas must pay after three days of hearings that began on Monday in the Federal Court in Sydney. Outside court, Transport Workers Union national secretary Michael Kaine said the hearing was the beginning of the end of \u201ca protracted, brutal, distressing set of litigation\u201d that started in 2020 after Qantas sacked the workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Qantas appealed the case all the way to the High Court, which unanimously upheld the Federal Court\u2019s finding it had breached the Fair Work Act by outsourcing the workers, preventing them from accessing industrial rights to collectively bargain and take protected industrial action. Last October, Lee ordered Qantas to pay $120 million to the workers as compensation for their economic loss, pain and suffering. The TWU is seeking that he impose the maximum penalty of $121 million. \u201cWe have to send a very strong, clear signal to Qantas and every other company in Australia that this can never, ever happen again to any Australian worker,\u201d Kaine said. In court, Qantas chief people officer Catherine Walsh told Lee that \u201chopefully you\u2019ll see from the size of the compensation payment that, in fact, we are very sorry\u201d. \u201cWe do wish for the workforce that was impacted to be properly remediated and the compensation that has been agreed could go some way to deal with that,\u201d she said. The compensation payments will start flowing to workers by the end of May, with a base payment of $10,000 for all workers. Outside court, Kaine said Qantas had \u201csaid sorry at two minutes to midnight\u201d. \u201cThey put it in an affidavit in these proceedings, because if you show contrition in penalty proceedings, the judge is bound to consider whether that should provide you with a discount on your penalty,\u201d he said. But he said the penalty should reflect the \u201chuman suffering, the family dislocation, the financial stress, the mental anguish, the family breakdowns\u201d directly resulting from Qantas\u2019 illegal conduct. Also outside court, former Qantas worker Tony Hayes said the saga was \u201cnever ending\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s been the same conversation for five years and we just want it to go away, but we want them to pay,\u201d he said. Another former worker Anne Guirguis said she was with the company for 28 years and thought she would retire there. \u201cI\u2019ve got colleagues that have lost houses and have been divorced, it\u2019s changed their world,\u201d she said. On Monday afternoon, Lee is expected to start hearing closing submissions from lawyers for Qantas and the TWU. -AAP",

        "raw_text": "Australia\u2019s biggest telecommunications company is facing allegations it misled customers by inflating claims of how far its network reached. In claims levelled by rival telco Vodafone, Telstra is accused of \u201cdramatically\u201d overstating its reach by as much as 40 per cent \u2013 for more than a decade. Vodafone, along with parent company TPG Telecom, said Telstra advertised its coverage based on a signal strength customers could get only if they used a special external antenna and a powered repeater that is usually installed on a vehicle or building. Vodafone said network coverage claims should be based on signal strength a mobile phone would usually get without any extra devices. TPG group executive Kieran Cooney said the allegations were \u201calarming\u201d and would have cost his company customers. \u201cIt appears Telstra has tricked Australians into paying top dollar for coverage they simply can\u2019t get on a regular mobile phone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are calling on them to make it right \u2026 Telstra\u2019s conduct could have misled consumers into believing they can get coverage in places that require special equipment.\u201d Specifically, TPG alleged Telstra claimed its mobile network was about a million square kilometres greater than it actually was because it based its figures on the use of an antenna and repeater. It also said the network covered 99.7 per cent of the population based on using those same devices. Telstra recently updated its coverage claims to note that the 99.7 per cent mark required an external antenna. It has been contacted for comment TPG has reported Telstra to the consumer watchdog, called for a regulatory investigation and threatened legal action to stop the practice and potentially force a compensation payment. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said it is considering the claims but would not confirm an investigation into Telstra. \u201cMobile operators do not have a standardised or consistent approach to the coverage maps they publish via their websites and in advertising,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cWe continue to urge mobile operators to provide comparable coverage maps \u2026 there is no legal requirement for mobile network operators to provide this, but the ACCC has been advocating for more transparency for consumers for some time.\u201d Australians in regional and remote areas would pay extra for Telstra service because they believed it was the only option for reliable coverage, a consumer group said. \u201cIf this allegation is true \u2013 and the coverage advantage is not as big as people have been led to believe \u2013 regional consumers would be forgiven for feeling betrayed,\u201d Australian Communications Consumer Action Network chief executive Carol Bennett said. \u201cWhen consumers are misled, markets are distorted, and trust is eroded.\u201d -AAP",

        "raw_text": "A clear majority of economists believe the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut interest rates at its next meeting on Tuesday, but developments abroad mean it\u2019s no longer a sure thing. US President Donald Trump recently slashed tariffs on China to 35 per cent from a whopping 145 per cent, prompting Beijing to lower its own tariff wall and triggering a rebound in values for riskier assets such as shares. Following strong labour market data released on Thursday, the market now predicts three rate cuts by year\u2019s end, down from four priced in at the start of the week. But traders are still nearly fully priced in for a 25 basis point cut to the cash rate, which sits at 4.1 per cent, on Tuesday. Almost nine in 10 economists agreed in a survey by comparison website Finder. Oxford Economics Australia\u2019s Sean Langcake is among the vast majority of the 41 economists surveyed who predict a cash rate reduction. Despite better news on the tariff front, the economy would still be negatively impacted by the \u201cuncertainty shock\u201d, Langcake said. \u201cWith upside inflation risks dissipating, the RBA can afford to lend the economy some more support,\u201d he said. Economists at all four big banks also expect a cut, with NAB still holding onto its prediction of a turbocharged 50 basis point cut. Nomura analysts Andrew Ticehurst and David Seif said the case for an \u201caggressive\u201d 50-point cut was relatively weak, given the detente in the Sino-American trade war. \u201cWe expect the RBA to deliver a 25 basis point rate cut, reflecting both further welcome progress in returning core inflation back towards target and the continuing highly uncertain global backdrop,\u201d the pair said. The central bank will also update its quarterly economic predictions on Tuesday in an otherwise quiet week on the data front. The Victorian government will unveil its budget on the same day, with ratings agency S&P Global warning the nation\u2019s most indebted state to rein in spending or risk seeing its AA credit rating downgraded further. Meanwhile, US markets were buoyed by the tariff reprieve, rising for their fifth day in a row by the end of the week. Australian shares reached a three-month high on Friday after eight straight sessions of gains. -AAP",

This year\u2019s shortlist features more than 150 homes from the country\u2019s most celebrated designers. Launched in 2010, the awards celebrate projects across 10 categories, including New House (under and over 200 square metres), House Alteration and Addition (under and over 200 square metres), Apartment or Unit, Sustainability, House in a Heritage Context, Emerging Architecture Practice, Australian House of the Year, and the newly created Small Project. The Small Project award will recognise the innovation and impact in small builds such as granny flats, studios, workshops, pergolas and pool houses. This year\u2019s panel of jurors included John Ellway from John Ellway Architect, Polly Harbison, principal of Polly Harbison Design, Dimmity Walker, director of Spaceagency Architects and John Wardle, founder of Wardle. They are joined by jury chair Alexa Kempton, editor ofHousesmagazine and Architecture Media, as well as Louise Honman as the heritage advisor and Pippa Soccio as the sustainability advisor. Kempton said an emerging theme in this year\u2019s shortlist was about \u201cdesigning smarter, rather than bigger\u201d. \u201cIncreasingly, we see architects telling clients, \u2018You don\u2019t need more space \u2013 you need better design\u2019,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThe jury observed modestly scaled new houses as well as clever interventions to existing homes, and applauded this continued emphasis on responsible residential design.\u201d Other themes that emerged in this year\u2019s shortlist include a celebration of the iconic beach shack, colourful interiors, unique homes, imaginative responses to existing housing and homes for play. \u201cPostwar apartments, beach shacks, project homes \u2013 these familiar housing types are often ripe for formulaic updates,\u201d Kempton said. \u201cBut in this year\u2019s shortlisted homes, the jury observed something bolder: inventive, out-of-the-box transformations that celebrate Australia\u2019s existing housing stock,\u201d she added. \u201cThese projects prove you don\u2019t need to demolish to make something remarkable from the homes already found in our suburbs.\u201d The jury found that homes in this year\u2019s shortlist represented innovative design for \u201cthe full spectrum of Australian life.\u201d \u201cThe jury saw many homes that respond to the demographic diversity in contemporary Australia, encompassing downsizers, sole occupants and those who want to age in place,\u201d Kempton said. Winners of the awards will be announced at a gala event at the State Library of NSW on August 1.

        "raw_text": "Without the Albanese government\u2019s Labor\u2019s energy policies, the recent federal election could have had a very different outcome. Amid rising household electricity and gas prices, research released today shows a direct correlation between \u2018energy poverty\u2019 and voting patterns in Australia. The study from the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at the University of Melbournesheds light on how the struggle to pay energy bills can influence voting preferences and potentially shape a country\u2019s political landscape. It reveals that one in seven(around 14 per cent) ofAustralian households identify as being energy poor andare less likely to support either major party \u2013 Labor or the Coalition. Recent pollingfrom the Australian election suggests that the Coalition got 32.2 per cent of the primary vote, while minor parties and independents received 33.1 per cent. This is likely to be the first time that the minor party vote is set to beat a major party. Energy poverty is defined as the inability to afford basic energy services, such as heating and cooling a home, to achieve a decent standard of living. Data from the Melbourne Institute \u2013 Roy Morgan Taking the Pulse of the Nation (TTPN) survey reveals that energy-poor households are 1.4 times more likely to vote for right-wing, populist minor parties. However, in the recent election we observed that the Labor party successfully campaigned on energy policies that included subsidies and their energy relief package is likely to have softened perceptions that renewable energy is associated with higher energy costs. In contrast, the Coalition\u2019s nuclear policies lacked significant detail and were devoid of financial compensation, potentially contributing to their less favourable outcome. As observed in consecutive Australian election campaigns, energy policy is an increasingly polarised issue. Labor, the Greens, and Teal independents push for decarbonisation, which can potentially lead to short-term price hikes. The Coalition frames these policies as the culprit for high electricity prices, and far-right parties like One Nation and Trumpet of Patriots blame Australia\u2019s commitment to international climate agreements. These messages resonate profoundly with those struggling to keep the lights on. Who are these energy-poor voters? They\u2019re not a monolithic group. Data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics (HILDA) Survey shows us that they are young people grappling with high housing costs, households who have members with long-term illnesses, families with young children, the unemployed, and disproportionately women and Indigenous Australians. More importantly they\u2019re our neighbours in regional areas, where energy alternatives are limited and costs run high. Since 2001, 2-4 per cent of the HILDA Survey respondents have reported being unable to adequately heat their homes due to financial constraints, and about 14 per cent of households have consistently struggled to pay their bills on time. The new research also shows that the Coalition\u2019s fossil fuel-aligned stance appears to resonate more with the energy poor demographic and those in energy poverty reduce their support for Labor more than they do for the Coalition. While this seems to contradict the recent Labor win, we can speculate why this have occurred by using international voting trends. In 2011, energy poverty reached its peak, reflecting wholesale market and network costs. Through the following decade, there were modest reductions in energy poverty. Between 2022-2023, Australians experienced another spike in energy poverty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which generated sustained inflationary pressures across global economies. These escalating global pressures are not only affecting Australians. Similar patterns have been observed in the US and Europe, where economic insecurity fuels right-wing populism. As energy poverty rises, so does the potential for political instability and the erosion of support for climate action. These patterns align with protest voting theories, where economic hardship drives voters towards non-traditional political options. There are examples to draw on from recent elections in Spain and Sweden. In both instances, governments successfully campaigned for policies to phase out fossil fuels. Their policies were coupled with clear communication around the nuances of transition strategies and most importantly, economic compensation was provided to affected communities. This research linking energy poverty to voter disaffection is just one of the empirically proven reasons for us to understand this political shift away from the major parties. By understanding these political trends overseas, we can likely infer that energy poverty has influenced our recent election. Political leaders in Australia must find a way to balance the urgent need for climate action with the immediate economic realities we face. Failure to do so can lead to voter disaffection, where people feel the policies have failed them in terms of energy affordability. How political leaders tackle this complex issue may influence Australia\u2019s political landscape and policy directions. Balancing policy that addresses immediate economic pressures and long-term environmental goals to combat climate change can only be successful if they do not inadvertently alienate vulnerable populations. Dr Kushneel Prakash is a Melbourne Postdoctoral Fellow at the Melbourne Institute: Applied Economic and Social Research at the University of Melbourne. He will be presenting the findings of the energy research he co-authoredat the upcomingMelbourne Economic Forum.",

        "raw_text": "A flyer landed in my hands. It was an invitation to the Australian Housing Conference in Sydney. The flyer spoke of bringing a broad range of housing providers and consumer all over Australia to improve the provision of housing on a more equitable basis. Sounds great! Where do I sign up? I scan the front page of the flyer for a web address or email. All I see is a phone number and a Telex number. Telex? Is that a new app? Nope, we are talking about the ancient predecessor of email. Telex machines were used by business and government to send typed messages instantly over long distances using phone lines before fax and email existed. Just how old is this flyer?! Oh, it\u2019s from 1982 but it really reads like it refers to 2025. Let\u2019s revisit the conference goals, one by one\u2014and see how far we\u2019ve come (or not).  Objective 1: Affirm and extend support for the social and economic importance of housing Australia failed to create or import enough construction workers to build enough housing and drive down construction costs in the process. The relatively few people that ended up working in the construction sector can now charge high wages \u2013 good for them but it drives up the labour component of housing massively. We succeeded in stabilising housing finance \u2013 by making it easier for banks to sell us massive loans. Building standards have improved since 1982 and we now live in better and safer dwellings \u2013 that\u2019s a win. Unfortunately, housing is much less affordable (in 1982 a house set you back 3-4 times your annual income but now costs about 8-10 times your income) and led more people to reside in dwellings that are too small for their needs. Now only a mere four per cent of the housing stock are public housing. Over the last 40+ years a large number of federal governments consistently failed the poorest Australians by allowing the public housing stock to decline.  At our 1982 conference, attendees chose which seminars they would want to attend. If you run a housing conference in 2025, you can offer the exact seminars. We have not markedly changed the system in which we provide housing since 1982. Are you expecting any changes, now that we have a new (old) government? Change is just around the corner \u2013 any decade now\u2026 Now that we discussed the harsh housing realities let\u2019s focus more on the broader social and historical shifts hinted at in the flyer.  Of the hotels suggested in the flyer I could only identify one as still operating. TheWentworthin Sydney is now theSofitel Sydney Wentworthand a nightly rate starts at around $276. The cost per night went up fourfold over 43 years. This seems roughly in line with house price increases in Sydney over that time. For our 2025 copy-cat housing conference we should be able to negotiate a discounted conference rate too.  The conference had an official airline partner. Trans Australian Airlines (TAA) might sound like a hyper progressive airline to young readers in 2025 but was of course a government-owned airline established in 1946 that was meant to provide affordable, reliable air travel across Australia. The goal was to break the private sector\u2019s aviation monopoly. TAA was known for innovation and high service standards. In 1986, it was rebranded as Australian Airlines, and in 1992, it was merged into Qantas following the airline\u2019s privatization. Today, conferences don\u2019t have an official airline partner anymore. We also book our own flights and don\u2019t need to mail a cheque with the registration fee anymore. The fee to participate at this truly timeless housing conference was a mere $50 \u2013 a true bargain considering that a conference like this could\u2019ve been repeated unchanged for the last 43 years. I also noticed that the Australian Labor Party was the only political Party listed as a participant. Perhaps Labor\u2019s new housing minister can ring up a few attendees from 1982. After all, they\u2019ve had 43 years to come up with a plan to make housing more equitable and affordable.
